  "text": "These are Everett, Israel, Max. Just let us know when we have a one minute warning. Oh, good morning, fourth. Today is October 17th and the commission calls to order. Docket No. 55973. Excuse me, city of Cartersville versus joint power company. May I have the appearance of. Thank you. Steve, you would send in Matt Dagle on behalf of Georgia Power Company. Thank you. Well, Mr. Connolly. And. Thank you. Yeah, I'm sorry. Thank you. Again, Steve, you send in behalf of Georgia Power Company. I probably, since there's only by list in this room, I should probably actually introduce my client is well Natalie beesman with Georgia Power Company. Nice speech. All right. I would reserve five minutes for a bottle. If I may. This case, uh, Cartersville versus Georgia Power Company, uh, is a dispute between city of Cartersville and Georgia power regarding which party is the law for right to provide electric service to warehouse term manufacturing facility located in Carter's for Georgia. The facts well into these motions today are not in dispute. The premises is located in Georgia power territory. There is no dispute that Georgia power has provided electric service to the premises since construction began in December of 2020. Georgia power served premises with permanent facilities since February 2022. And the initial electric load of the premises after construction was less than 900 kW. In other words, there is no disputing that the premises did not qualify for customer choice when it was completed and began taking permanent electric service from Georgia power. Rather Cartersville's entire argument for customer choice relies on a flawed interpretation of the Territorial Act Act OCGA 46 3-8 B, which is the exception to the grandfather rule within the Territorial Act Act related to a premises being destroyed or dismantled and not being reconstructed in substantial kind. Under any logical interpretation of the summer statutory language. Cartersville Cartersville's argument fails. Although Cartersville claims to dispute somebody operative facts to avoid summary judgment, it is clear from their own filings that they have no basis upon which to dispute those facts. In response to our motion for summary judgment, Cartersville relies on language from Walton EMC versus Georgia power to argue that mixed questions of law and fact are inappropriate for summary adjudication. That may be the case when material facts related to changes in the premises are in dispute, but as we explained in our reply brief or purposes of the motion for summary judgment, Georgia power accepts all facts alleged by petitioner regarding changes to the premises. Because there are no longer any issues of fact to resolve the case can and should in our estimation be decided on summary judgment without the need for an evidentiary hearing. Accepting all the facts alleged by Carter's villain its filings and testimony is true, the record is completely devoid of any evidence that the premises have been destroyed or dismantled. The Walton case defines destroyed as quote the complete reundition or tearing down or breaking down of the premises and quote. It defines dismantled as quote something less which may for example be accomplished by substantially taking apart or substantially stripping. Cartersville for native with me a part power to install breaker and voltage regulators. Cartersville install the transformer. But the utility must first have a lawful right to serve a premises before it can perform the work to serve it. And so it's turning that sequence on its head by claiming that the work it did to make the service possible somehow proves it has the right to serve the premises in the first place. That's exactly backwards and should not be rewarded. Although not found in Carter's little briefing or testimony, we did the work ourselves and search the record for evidence of destruction or dismantlement. In petitioners exhibit 14, which is the 235 pages of construction plans that cardinal sites to as the conversion plan. There is one single page demolition plan for the premises that amounts to removal of 896 square feet of wall and four exterior bay doors. By our calculation that amounts to about 1% of the premises exterior walls. Under the most generous definition of destroy or dismantle. There is no way to define the work done at the premises as a destruction or dismantling. Certainly there is no commission precedent under which the facts of this case can support a finding that the premises has been destroyed or dismantled. At bottom, Carter'sville has filed a petition seeking the commission's blessing to serve a premises that does not qualify for customer choice. Practically speaking, under Carter's interpretation of the Territorial Act Act, the destroyed or dismantled exception to the grandfather clause would be completely eviscerated by the of any plane meeting of the words used in that statute. Cartersville would have you rule that merely adding equipment to a premises and increasing its electrical load. The fact that the premises would suffice to meet the exception to the Territorial Act Act. They say as much on page 18 of their reply brief where they discuss the equipment added to the property and then argue that quote from these facts alone, the Hearing Officer could conclude that the premises was substantially taken part and quote. But nothing was ever taken apart and no real structural changes were made to the premises. Certainly not substantial changes like the Walton decision requires. The distribution warehouse has been served by the same electric supplier for 10 years. That warehouse gets purchased by a new owner who decides to use it as a manufacturing facility. So they bring in a bunch of new equipment that uses more electricity than the warehouse did. They had wire they had conduit. They had transformers, but they didn't make a single change to the building structure. They destroy nothing. They dismantle nothing. The Cartersville's interpretation of the Territorial Act Act they believe that getting a new tenant who expands the premises has created a quote new premises that has been both destroyed or dismantled as that term is used in the Territorial Act Act. That interpretation stands on its head all commission precedent interpreting this exception to the grandfather clause. And can't possibly be in a meeting of destroyed or dismantled as intended by the draptures of the statute. It certainly is not supported by the seminal decision in this area of Walton EMC versus Georgia Power. Because the record is devoid of any evidence of destruction or dismantlement. Georgia Powers entitled summary judgment and we ask that you rule a port. Thank you. Good morning. Chuck Connelly again, the petition of city of watersville. In their briefing, um, towards a power advances three arguments as to why the premises that issued is not qualified for customer choice under territory. The first argument is the premises is not new. The second argument is that the connected load and initial full operation of premises was less than 900 kilo. The first argument is that the premises does not have single meager service. Now, in oral argument, I didn't hear a lot of discussion, frankly, about any of those 30. The discussion centered on whether premises has been destroyed or dismantled and not reconstructed in substantial kind. But just to make sure the record is clear, at least with respect to two of the arguments that were advanced by Georgia Power and their briefing. We believe that those arguments were squarely addressed just nine months ago in the George spring for decision, Walton, Walton, the EMC. I do want to note for the record the Georgia power was a party today case. They were actually the petitioner in that case and they advanced similar arguments to those that they're advancing in this case, which were not only rejected by the Georgia Supreme Court. But they were also rejected by the Hearing Officer assigned in that case as well as the Public Service Commission. Now, for obvious reasons, we have an extensive discussion of Walton and EMC in our brief. I'm not going to repeat that for our purposes today. Let me just summer. First argument, Georgia power makes is focusing on OCGA §46-3-8(A). Well, that issue was expressly addressed in Walton, EMC and the Georgia Supreme Court said premises does not have to be known. What Georgia Supreme Court did was to clarify that OCGA §46-3-8(A) is explicitly made subject to subject subsection B. Therefore, if a premises is destroyed or dismantled and not reconstructed in substantial kind under subsection B, it is treated as a new premises as that term is understood in subsection A. The second argument for the power advances is that at initial full operation, for our purposes, at least initial full operation means that when the fire owner first developed the premises as a speculative office warehouse space. And again, our position is and I'll come back to this in a minute that Walton EMC also resolves that issue in our favor. So we believe that the central question in this case is whether the premises that issue was destroyed or dismantled and not reconstructed in substantial kind as those terms are used in the statute. And if it was at the time of its reconstruction was the connected load 900 kW or great. And as the Georgia Supreme Court said in Walton, this type of mixed question requires of a nuanced case by case characterization assessment or judgment of whether the given historical facts are properly characterized as meeting the legal standard in summary. And then there's the third issue that I didn't hear Mr. Hewitson an aggressive on argument that is the single me your service issue and I will spend a few minutes on yet. We do respond in our brief to their statement of a undisputed material facts. And also this about 17 and numerated additional facts that we think are material in this case. We also set forth the summary judgment standard and again a lengthy discussion of Walton EMC which for in the interest of time, I will go through here. But let me go back to the initial question or the initial argument made by Georgia Power for just a minute. The question is not in this case, whether the premises is new. Again, as the Walton board articulated the question in this case is whether the premises was destroyed or dismantled and not reconstruct reconstructed in substantial kind. If it is then it is treated as new under Territorial Act and again, we think the record if the record establishes that a new customer in this case Acker destroyed or dismantled the premises and did not reconstruct it in substantial kind. It doesn't matter whether the premises was new. They rely on Jackson EMC is a book for that argument Jackson and EMC is distinguishable in this case it didn't even involve the same issue. In that case, the issue was whether the same customer, a church, who had previously elected Georgia power as its electric service provider that then change its mind and choose a different electric service provider didn't do have anything to do with whether a premises had been destroyed. Or dismantled, not reconstructed in substantial kind. It really turned on the question of whether the customer choice in that case constitute a binding contract and that's not the issue in our case. As to the second issue and that is whether the premises had a connected load of 900 kW at initial operation. The argument Georgia power advances is that for that purpose initial operation when the prior owner developed the property for office warehouse speculative officer house and not when Acker transformed the facility into an actual manufacturing facility. Georgia port of appeals has recognized that the terms connected load and initial full operation as defined in the territory or not defined in the territory. In Georgia power argues that initial full operation means when the former owner first operated premises as an office and were having sort of developed in this one. I will say, respectively, the record does not reflect that Hines ever actually operated the premises as an office warehouse. In fact, our position is the record reflects just the opposite. The premises was constructed as speculative office warehouse distribution space. But before it was ever used as such at for discovered the premises, brew a broker and then converted premises to an actual manufacturing facility. Even if it had been operated. Georgia power argument is once again, you control and foreclosed by Walton EMC. If Georgia power was correct in Walton EMC, the relevant inquiry would have been what was the initial what was the connected load when the premises first operated as a textile mill decades early. Not as spring port determined, which was after the facility had been converted from a textile mill to an actual pet food manufacturing facility. It is the point at which premises has been destroyed or dismantled and not reconstructed in substantial kind that is the initial operation for our purposes. I think that that is pretty clearly set forth in the Walton case. In our case, there's not even a contest. We don't think as to whether when Acker started operating premises, the connected load was not under kilowatt's or greater. They're trying to move the goal post back to when the property was initially developed, the speculative office and warehouse space. And that is not the relevant inquiry under the Walton case. Let me get to the end of sort of the central issue, which is whether the premises was destroyed or dismantled and not reconstructed in substantial kind. Again, I will emphasize the Walton court says that this is a mixed question. Law in fact, that requires a nuanced case by case characterization assessment or judgment and is typically not subject summary adjudication. Now, that said, the Georgia Supreme Court spent a good bit of time talking about what destroyed or dismantled reconstructed and substantial kind mean under statute. And I do think what the Supreme Court said in that regard is important. So here's what the court said. We conclude that destroyed refers to the complete ruination or tearing down or breaking down of the premises. While dismantled means something less, which may for example be accomplished by substantially taking a part or substantially stripping away, a building structural components furniture equipment or other significant content. Without the added requirement of entire destruction. What we know to say we hold therefore that the court of appeals aired an interpreting destroyed or dismantled to require the premises to be taken apart disassembled or ruined and holistic rather than partial men. We want to talk then about reconstructed and substantial kind or said we have no trouble concluding. In order to parties disagree that reconstructed and substantial kind means reconstructed premises that are largely, but not wholly of the same fundamental nature quality as they were previously. Taken together we can through the phrase destroyed or dismantled in which are reconstructed and substantial kind as extending an electric suppliers exclusive rights continue serving the premises. The premises are completely ruined or torn or broken down or short of the entire destruction the premises are substantially taken apart or the premises structural components furniture equipment or other significant contents are substantially stripped away. And the premises are constructed again largely but not wholly of the same fundamental nature quality as they were previously that's how the Waltenport articulate. So let me turn to the facts of this case again the premises that issue was constructed as a speculative office warehouse distribution facility in the 2021 2022 time. But before it was ever operated as such at for the tenant the customer discovered the premises in March of 2023 through a row at for then converted the premises to an actual manufacturing facility primarily to manufacture a loan table truck. The conversion of the premises to a manufacturing facility involved a set of construction plans consisting of 235 pages those plans are in the record of this case the cost of the conversion to the kinds the previous owner was four round numbers four and a half million dollars. The cost to Acker the tenant the customer was two million which included considerable investment in the electrical infrastructure inside the facility to meet the needs of Acker testimony in the record of this case from an electrical among other things at for had to upgrade their switch and full additional secondary wire to each transformer from an electrical power standpoint. Premises as initially constructed by a Hines was served by 300 kVA transport. However, load test showed that Acker electrical power needs would be 1.5 MW requiring a 1500 kVA transformer or transformer five times the size of that initially serving premises. In order to extend service to the premises hardest had to acquire a substation breaker and design and deal free phase service to the premises. In fact, cars will provide 14,500 feet of free phase service to the premises. Particle coordinated with me at how to install a breaker voltage regulators in the substation to support the increased load. Particle performed the overhead line installing approximately 3000 feet of overhead primary wire they contracted with crews to install around 12,390 feet of underground primary conduct. They installed another 500 kVA transformer to the rear of the to also serve Acker select. So Carter's will stand 600 pounds to extend electric power to the premises so between the original owner. Acker and far as well, $7 million will stand in the conversion of this facility from speculative office warehouse base to an actual manufacturing facility. Our position is these facts alone would allow the Hearing Officer to conclude that the premises was substantially taken apart. That the premises structural components furniture equipment and other significant content for substantial substantially stripped away such that the premises was dismantled as the wall to the MC for constructs. We also think that the Hearing Officer concluded that the reconstruction of the premises was not the same fundamental nature of quality as was there previously, which again, the wall to forward instruct at a minimum we believe that summary adjudication as to these issues was not properly. So, again, I want to talk about the single meter service issue just because of their basis for moving for summary judgment. I know only that I don't think. As it relates to single meter service, it appears that Georgia powers are in the simple. That the premises is being served through four separate meters separately, metering the electric service to the premise and in 40 to Georgia Power that it's so packed on means that they can't be single meter service. But they don't cite a single Georgia case where the courts are determined that having more than one meter necessarily means that the single meter service requirement isn't met. And in fact, the Georgia Court of Appeals has said just the office we cite the Central Georgia EMC case in our brief. Georgia Court of Appeals says the commission has consistently refused to rely on the number of meters as the single dividing factor and deciding cases under the grandfather clause and the Territorial Act. In central Georgia, MC, the issue was whether a new gym that was constructed on the same campus as a hospital, but was separately meter was nevertheless part of the same premises of the hospital. And the court of appeals again said whether there's one meter or more than one meters is not a positive. Rather, you have to examine other fact. Is there a common electrical system for the existing building? Is there a power bill that sent to the same customer is it paid by the same cuts. So there are other things you need to look at in the case in order to determine whether single meter is the single meter requirement is met other than just the number of meters. We similarly cite a PSE decision Georgia Power Company versus Carol EMC where again the number of meters was not responsive, even though there were separate meters in those cases. The mission determined single meter requirement was met. We cite a case by the Georgia Supreme Court, which again, at least confirms that having more than one meter is not responsive in our case. We have one building occupied by one customer. There are no other tenants in the premises other than that. And while they're four separate meters at the premises, they serve same building, they serve same customer, a bill is sent to the same customer and a single customer pays the bill. And again, our position is those facts are sufficient to satisfy the single meter service requirement under the Territorial Act. Just briefly on the single meter issue, single meter service issue. I did not focus on that primarily because I think our pleadings on that issue are very clear. Also, that is an issue that only is only reached if Hearing Officer determines that the property has been dismantled or destroyed or dismantled and not reconstructed in substantial kind of. And I do not believe the facts of this case need to that. I think some judgment is granted before you even reach that we had that in our pleadings or in our briefing for completeness sake. We also in our motion for summary judgment went through the requirements on the Georgia law to establish a Georgia power has a right to serve the premises so that established the grandfather clause. And that is why the initial arguments in the briefing were included my discussion earlier today focused on Carter's bill of response brief and their arguments that they are they qualify for the destroyed dismantled exception. Which is why I focus there. The facts of this case are vastly different than the facts of the case in Walton, her story part EMC Mr. Connellyy re sites to 17 additional facts and the brief. But those facts don't support the exception to the grandfather rule. I went through the five facts of those 17 that have anything to do with changes to the property. They are all additive with the exception of one, which was to replace some of the wiring and the conduit within the facility. Everything else was additive to the property and everything else was outside of the premises itself. The point that Mr. Connellyy makes is that. Heins never actually operated the property. He argues that initial full operation premises should be went Acker took over the property from Hines. But the record in this case establishes that the premises was built and fully operational as originally designed as a warehouse in April of 2022 at the latest. And that in the record, a petitioners exhibit key 23, which is a certificate of completion for the premises dated April 21, 2022. So the property was completed. Georgia power was the service provider and Georgia power was providing service to the property. The grandfather clause was established or service to the right to serve the property premises was established when that happened. And Georgia power was the lawful provider of the service. While I understand that cards will argue that the premises became new under the Territorial Act Act when act were moved in. The record is proceeding only established that Acker expanded the facility. It did not destroy or dismantle the facility. And I would cite you to the Douglas County EMC versus Georgia Power Company decision where the commission explained that the adopted definition of initial full operation of the premises will should not be construed to mean that if a consumer has plans for future growth. Or hopes to expand its facilities in the future such that the expanded facilities would result in a connected load of 900 KW or greater that the facility would qualify under the exception set for the nOCGA such as 46-3-8 sub part A. And I would say that the property is directly on point what Acker or what Cartersville is attempting to establish in this proceeding is that they have added to the property and they have expanded the property to be a manufacturing facility rather than a warehouse. And I would say that the other evidence everything in the in the briefing all of their pre-filed testimony and exhibits established that they added facilities most of them outside the property. I will make note that the 235 page construction plan that Mr. Conner is sites to is actually about four copies of the construction plan. It's about 70 some pages of the construction plan. But again, as I said earlier, if you look for what has been just destroyed or dismantled, there is a one page demolition plan in there that shows 896 clear feet of the property being being much that's about 1% of the exterior walls. In that case, the Hearing Officer and the Georgia Supreme Court went through great lengths to describe the changes of property, the substantial physical changes to the property in great detail to establish that it was destroyed and dismantled. How much was changed, how much was spent and how the property was completely different substantially different than it had been prior to the work done here, what you have, you have a spec warehouse, I guess, that was built completed and served by Georgia power. So a new owner comes in and installed new equipment does not destroy anything does not dismantle anything and then establishes facilities outside of the premises, the wiring, the overhead line, the underground conduit and argues that that means the premises has been destroyed and dismantled that would stand the precedent of this commission on its head and completely this rate, the Territorial Act Act and its exceptions. Unless there are any questions, that's all I have. Thank you very much. Thank you. Do you want to just roll right into the next motion? No, it's the old one right. I'm fine. That's just bad. The next motion is Georgia Powers objections to pre-filed direct testimony, I can't imagine that I'm going to need to reserve five minutes for a bottle, but I will anyway just as a family to make sure. Georgia power has moved to strike portions of the pre-filed rebuttal testimony of Robert Benjamin. Butcher for offering improper legal conclusions and then while unqualified expert opinions specifically, there are two sections of Mr. butcher's testimony that Georgia Power objects to is page three lines 19 to 21, which states, quote, but so long as those meters are serving the same premises and are billed to the same customer that would still be considered, quote single meter, certain single, quote under the territory. The second section is page five line 16 through page six line one where the question is, and based on your review of these documents and the other documents you mentioned earlier, what is your testimony as to the connected load at the ECHPOR facility at the time of initial full operation of the premises answer that it's easily exceed that it easily exceeded 900 kW. The first section seek to provide testimony containing invisible legal conclusions regarding whether the legal requirements for single meter service and initial full operation are met as required by the Territorial Act Act to establish eligibility for the large load exception witness butcher is not a lawyer, he is not being qualified as an expert with witness to offer these opinions and they should be strict. So if you want to talk about how the current company versus Carol EMC, the Commission explained that the phrase initial full operation in the term of art and determinations of such are legal conclusions left to the sound discretion of the commission specifically, the commission noted that quote reliance on expert opinion to determine the existence or date of initial full operation, we costume an add education by the commission of its duties as trial effect witness, butcher is not an attorney and undertake load counts. Is legal conclusion regarding when initial full operation occurred and whether the connected load satisfies the 900 KW threshold within the Territorial Act Act, fall squarely within the purview of the commission in you as the Hearing Officer and should be reject. Similarly witness butchers testimony that the premises would be considered as receiving single meter service under the Territorial Act Act is a legal conclusion regarding the satisfaction of the single meter service requirement of the Territorial Act Acts, large load exception is testimony that service for the premises. Being built to one customer satisfies the legal requirement for single meter service offers a legal interpretation of whether the facts of this case satisfy this problem of the requirement or customer choice. That determination is for the commission to make based on your view the facts in this case, it is a legal conclusion and should be rejected. We'll make one note about this motion, this motion is a perfect motion if we get to be full hearing none of the facts none of the evidence that I'm speaking about Mr. Brutcher's testimony goes to whether a card bills changes to the property or Acker expansion of the facility destroys or dismantles the facility. So none of Mr. Brutcher's testimony is relevant to this motion for summary judgment or completely separate and you only have to reach them if you rule that that summary judgment is not proper and go to power. Thank you. As I understand their motion or their objection at least I don't believe that Georgia Power objects to most of what is contained in Mr. Brutcher's pre file testimony by way of example he talks about his experience in his experience. It's not uncommon for a large facility like the at full facility have multiple meters, especially when there are multiple service points at the facility. You know, all for testimony that sometimes the electric supplier to the facility will even suggest or require multiple meters. There's testimony distinguishing between connected load versus peak usage. And the fact that those two things are not the same and again, my understanding is Georgia Power does not object to those portions of Mr. Brutcher's testimony. What did a jet of Jets to or two specific statements and that is that the premises has single meter service. And the connected load at the time of the initial operation of the premises exceeded 900 kW now as to the second issue in terms at least in reading their objection as I understood it was a relevant suggestion. Because what they said was again you don't look at the initial operation at Ackers when they started operating rather the relevant inquiry is when kinds. And the real deal that has spec office space and because Mr. butcher didn't look at that issue but instead looked at what was the connected load when Acker reconstructed the facility that their objection was based on relevance. I would submit to the Hearing Officer that if you determine as the Walton EMC court instructs that the relevant inquiry is when at core reconstructed the facility when it was originally constructed again when I emphasize the facts and in Walton that facility in Walton had been operated for decades as a textile. It was converted to a pet food manufacturing facility the inquiry was not what was the connected load when it was initially built as a textile facility. The relevant inquiry is when it was converted to a pet food manufacturing facility so again my understanding at least was that their objection on that though it was a relevance object. Now as to the second issue which I should say the first issue which is single meter service. I just know that Mr. butcher is a professional engineer he has been for nearly 15 years he has more than 20 years of experience and electric utilities business. He is the senior director of engineering and energy services for the electric cities of Georgia as such he is responsible for engineering and poll attachment services along customer choice and Territorial Act decisions. He could pretty clearly be established as an expert witness in this matter but even if he wasn't Georgia law clearly allows light witnesses to offer opinion testimony. The bigger point is this this is not a jury throw. Ultimately the Hearing Officer will determine whether the premises has single meter service as that as that set forth from the statute and whether the connected load at the time of initial full operations exceeded 900 kW and in making that determination you can rely or you will rely on the testimony and evidence presented. And in the case of opinion testimony you can give it as much or as little weight as you want to assign to it so our position is there's no reason to exclude the testimony ultimately you will make those determinations and again you'll give that testimony as much weight as you see fit. Not much to talk about there I will I will note that I understand that Mr. Fisher might be someone who could be qualified to give load count testimony but he is not in this proceeding and it was not established and it's the best. So it's an improper expert opinion for him to provide also his testimony regarding what constitutes single meter electric service and a Territorial Act Act would be illegal conclusion that would be in promise. Of course as Mr. Connellyy said this is before Hearing Officer and you can make those determinations and you will make those determinations if we get to that point. There is evidence in the record that Accors connected load was expected to be greater than I know KW after the expansion the facility we don't dispute that that's in there what which shooting is who gets to make those statements and I'm what happens and that's why we should stop. Thank you. I'm sure now my motion for lead the final supplemental refound right testimony. So if you look at our original pre-filed direct testimony. It included both testimony and two actual load studies that demonstrated that Acker is electric power needs would be 1.5 MW. We had assumed based on that that we would be able to stipulate that at least Ackers electric use at the time of initial operation is not have a kilowatt so I understand the legal argument the Georgia powers making which is that's not the relevant inquiry the relevant inquiries when Heinz built the respect office base. But at least today we've not gotten a stipulation that at Accors initial operations that connected load was 900 kW despite the fact that we got testimony into load studies in the record that effect. So it's out of abundance of caution and belt and suspenders I sent an expert witness out to the Accor facility to actually look at the face plates on the equipment out there and to do what would now be a third load study. Our request is to allow us to file supplemental pre-filed direct testimony to include that again just out of abundance of caution each move. If we can agree that at least at Accors initial operations the connected load was 900 kW or more if we can't then we'd like to present that testimony. So I would admit to Hearing Officer that we sent that load study to this few it's in August they've had several months now to look at it there's no prejudice to them if that testimony is allowed they're welcome if they really intend to contest it they're welcome to go out and get an expert go look at the face plates and make your own determination. There's no prejudice to them and it's not going to delay you know the proceedings in this matter we're here at the summary judgment stage if there's at least currently no final evidentiary hearing scheduled so our position is that there's no harm in allowing this testimony. Thank you. Yeah and Mr. Crown of lead I guess it's vanilla head to to a certain extent I mean Georgia power understands that Cartersville has introduced other load counts studies or other load studies of the premises dated from May of 2023 and August 2023 showing above 900 KW for a load count for at war the point that we are making also goes back to the motion for summary judgment. That the term connected load at initial for full operation as specific meaning under the Territorial Act it means the load to be furnished the customer at the time the customer commences full operation of the facility as design. The territory like to find premises as the building structure or facility to which electricity is being or is to be furnished is not dependent on the specific customer occupying premises for rather the premises itself once established the connected load of the premises for purpose in the Territorial Act Act does not change less premises is destroyed or dismantled which goes back to the motion for summary judgment the premises cannot clean customer choice under the large load exception. The Cartersville as completing connected load at the time of initial full operation premises with the load of a new tenant when it begins operating at an existing premises. A new customer occupying premises cannot simply undertake a new load count and create customer choice that's not what the Territorial Act meant act is meant for and that's not with grandfather clause or the exceptions to it are meant for that is what Cartersville motion seeks to interject into the record. And the proper testimony of a look at is the proper testimony of a load count undertaken in July of 2025. But as I said before the record in this case establishes that the premises was built and fully operational as originally designed in April of 2022 at the latest so a load count undertaken more than three years after the premises reach full operation is irrelevant to the proceeding again I understand the car is will argue that premises became new under the Territorial Act Act under their interpretation. Of distorting dismantled with a record only establishes that Acker expanded the facility did not destroy or dismantled the facility as we explain our objection this commission has already determined that plans for future expansions of the premises do not qualify the premises for the large load exception and that is said to you earlier the Douglas County EMC versus for power company case which is Docket No. 3686. And the record only establishes that Acker expanded the facility did not destroy or dismantle it the initial full operation of premises occurred in 2022 not July of 2025 and that load count at that time is a roll. Thank you very much. I'm going to go ahead and rule on these and my reasoning and will be excluded in the final order of this case after we have here and denying Georgia Power motion for summary. We're denying Georgia Power's full objections to testimony. I'm pretty much portions of people just. There's several reasons why they are and I'm green tea. The motion to leave the bottom supplement testimony on behalf of city. Mr. Cue it's an also easy opportunity to the bottom supplement. So we will go forward with the here and when I get back to my office our email news of potential days. I'm going to go ahead and see if you can see anything with the bounce check if you read this is so to see your calendar. I take it there will be well. Did you say that you were going to issue a written opinion on the knowledge of some. I'm going to pull that out to find more. Can we can we get a better understanding of what it is you think is the last to be old at another entry hearing since the facts related to the exception I'm not in this. I'm not going to say that again. Yeah, can I get a little bit I it would be helpful going into a hearing if I understood your view of what facts are at a speed that's. Out that I mean that in terms of summary judgment there are several issues of genuine issues of theory and. So there I mean that the testament will go forward as it's fine. Okay, but there isn't there aren't specific facts that would help us focus what the presentation that the hearings. I think I think I think that. All the facts and what it's a sculpture that are facts that need to be. Right, but those are facts that nobody has dispute that's that's my question is. Yeah, as I said at the beginning at the at the outside. For purposes of motion, the changes that Acker has made to the facility, the additional wire outside the facility none of that in the speed we don't dispute that that happened. So the question is whether it qualifies for the Territorial Act Act exception of storage, so trying to get a better understanding help focus at the hearing what facts. We should have because the hearing should be to establish the facts, but if we agreed that those are the facts. I'm having a little bit of difficulty and maybe I just need to go back to the office and think about a little bit more. And the difficulty of what presentation of elements you wanted to see. You have. In both of you listed on this. Yes. And they're big. You know what you're. So any any undisputed fact that is not really stipulated or of. It seems that. The issue. That. Artisticated. Clear. From. What should. You would not. You would not. You would not. The stipulate that. No, I thought. For the. It's even available because. I think that. I think that. I think that. Well, right. Right. But, but I also noted that. You don't dispute that Cartersville already has in the record two load counts from 2023 that established Acker's expected use of the properties overnight or paid up. So that. That facts. Not an issue. That's an issue. As to when. You are your. Currently. Or. Yeah. Initial. I think. I think. I think. Whether. Is it. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. You know, you're. As the Hearing Officer, you're within your rights to just deny those. Someone. And having. And here gets. And here. That's what I understand hearing. I'm. Further obligated to go through and I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. Thank you. Thank you. Not right now. And we're not. I want to check that out. We're not. 나도 did. When we were looking through, we were. What kind of something. He wants to. Why I think of, what do you want to hear here? But again, maybe I just need to go back and sit down and figure out what it is to make accuracy or read the transcript of this and understand what we're talking about. I'm going to make two. So, we may need to do this, but at this point, I'm gonna, I'll assume options for the actual here. I'm gonna make a change. Thank you. Thank you so much. That was it.",
