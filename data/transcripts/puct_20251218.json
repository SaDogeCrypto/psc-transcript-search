  "text": "This meeting of the Public Utility Commission of Texas will come to order to consider matters that have been duly posted with the Secretary of State for today, December 18, 2025. Good morning, everybody. Just real quick, before we get going, a bit of sad news, my friend, our friend, Tom Hunter, who retired a couple of months ago, if you all were kind of aware, his brother had been going through a lot of health concerns over the last year. That's why he was gone a lot when he was finishing up in my office. His brother actually passed away earlier this week. So Tom is a man of immense faith, and so I'd ask we keep him and his family in our prayers. If you know Tom well, I'm sure he'd appreciate some text or phone calls as he and Michelle and the rest of the family go through a really tough time. So I just want to let everybody know that. He does this right. I don't think he actually watches these meetings anymore since he retired. But if he does see it, I just want to let him know that we're thinking about him. We love him and we're here for whatever he needs to help him and his family get through this time. Second thing, if we have a bit of sad news, some joyous news, Commissioner, if I'm right, I think Tuesday was your birthday. You might be correct. Okay. I'm sure you want us to sing, but we'll refrain. But happy birthday. Thank you. What a way to celebrate preparing for the last open meeting of the year. It was wonderful. Yeah, I bet. Time will spend. Yeah. So, okay. Well, Connie, Sheila, good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. All right. So, commissioners, we have Ercott here. Pablo's here to talk about the largely interconnection process. So I'd suggest why don't we bring that item up first and then go back to item. So we'll bring up nine first and then go back to item six and go through the agenda. That works for everybody. Chairman, when would you like to do the consent agenda? We'll do it right now. You'll have it. Yeah. We'll do it right now. We'll make sure we're good for everything. I know you had that plan. Yeah. You know, there it is. Come for me. All right. So with that, Sheila, will you take us through the consent agenda, please? Yes. Good morning, commissioners. So by individual ballot, the following item was placed on your consent agenda from the contest to case items item number five. Items that will not be taken up are two, three and four and there are no items on the consent agenda for the roles and projects for this meeting. Thank you, Sheila. I would also say that item 16, if it's okay, commissioners, that we also do not take that item up today. I'd like a little more time on that. So if we could also delay item 16, I'd appreciate it. You good? Okay. All right. So with that, I'll entertain a motion to approve the consent agenda is laid out by Sheila. So moved. Second. Emotion is second. All those in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed? Motion prevails. They'll take us to item number one. Sheila, public comment. Has anyone signed up for public comment? Yes. We have one person that signed up for public comment. Joe Jimenez. Mr. Jimenez. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. My name is Joe Jimenez, former volunteer board president of the Windermere Oaks Water Supply Corporation from 2019 to 2023. My testimony in 5078 is on the interchange. For last year, I've been informing this commission about the consequences of adopting the Macobos Memorandum of December 13, 2023. Windermere recently released 2024 audits, confirms those warnings. Windermere posted a $271,000 loss in 2024. And at 2025, the board was forced to sell land simply to pay daily operators and to pay back a called loan. So far beyond 2025, the Cobos Memorandum destroyed Windermere's future ability to borrow. Commissioner Yaltman said at a PUC meeting in October 2024 that the commission made their decision because previous Windermere boards failed to perform their fiduciary duties. And I get it. The commissioners and staff did not like it that our 2020 board increased rates to pay legal fees to defend innocent board members against false allegations of criminal activity, like constructive fraud and racketeering. Texas Business Code Chapter 8 requires a corporation to pay the defensive innocent board members, but let's not quibble. And staff's preference for fiduciary duty, the Windermere board should have joined with plaintiffs and two lawsuits seeking to avoid the company's sale of four acres of land to a former board member in 2015. But as my board explained in 5078, three different Windermere boards, about a dozen people under the Council of three different attorneys, all chose not to join those plaintiffs and suing to break that land sale contract. It's good that the board members did not join the plaintiffs in that pursuit. It was good for Windermere that they did not do that. Judges at the District Appellate and Supreme Court levels all confirmed that avoiding the contract was never going to be a legal outcome despite the plaintiffs' bully demands. And had the boards fulfilled staff's desires using water company finances to sue the former board member, the deep pocketed Petytile company likely would have followed through on their threats to defend the contrAcker their inflating legal costs for losing cause. After the three-year rate case, the Commission and Brace Staff standards for fiduciary duty and those weren't close alignment with the rate pair representatives and their attorney, the same attorney who represented the plaintiffs in the underlying suits. Consider the character of those plaintiffs. They admitted and court in depositions to using a quote-unquote term of endearment for the former board member who bought the land. They called her Chups short for Chupacabra. The plaintiffs were also asked where they put the board member's photo in a toilet. They denied urinating on it, but admitted the photo was displayed in their hanger restroom. So when Commissioner Yaltman can't at least say that the Commission's punitive rate decision was based on his view of our failed fiduciary duty, she was endorsing staff's and by extension the plaintiff's standards for fiduciary duty. It was far removed from the proposal for decision by Judge Asianne Onwizman who weighed the legal issues and not staff's alignment with plaintiffs in windomere. Now that windomere's audited is in and now that windomere's audited is in, the Commission's co-bus member random is far removed from my view of good public policy for public water utility. Thank you for considering my views. Thank you. Commission has any questions for Mr. Minnes. Thanks for being here. Okay. So let's go then to item number nine. That's project number 5599. Reports of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. We have two updates. One on RTC plus B and then large load error connection. Populous here for the large load error connection piece. So let's go ahead and do that first, Pablo. And team. Pablo, thank you for being here this morning to talk through this. Yep. Thank you, Chairman. Appreciate it. Good morning, Commissioners. Happy birthday, Commissioner Johnson. So I want to talk about the kind of the future of the public water supply. Of the large load interconnection process. We filed comments earlier in the week about kind of the way things work today. It was going to queue in a format to help kind of answer questions about our current process and how the new picker 115 intersects into that. What we really want to talk about today is what we believe are some needed changes in order to help manage the the large load volume and pace that's coming our way. So you know, to this level set, what we're dealing with today is fairly unprecedented. The processes that we've historically used to connect large loads are not providing the clarity or the certainty that's needed for developers. So we've made improvements to those processes. Picker 115 is one of those. Those changes, however, are already insufficient to manage the increases and the volume that we are seeing coming through. So we still need to continue to work on this and we think additional changes are needed. What we're fundamentally dealing with here today is an optimization problem that's needed over the next several years. Because the solution long term is the development of infrastructure that's going to be able to serve the needs of these large loads over time. And that process is underway. We've already seen a significant amount of transmission being proposed in order to meet that. Our large load forecast anticipates the loads that are coming into the state and has put forth RTPs and plans in order to address and build towards that. However, the pace at which that infrastructure can be built is generally longer slower than what we can see developing on the large loads that are coming to the state. So there is an interim period of time where we have to manage how to connect those large loads in a reliable way and do so expeditiously. And in a way that optimizes the capacity that is on the grid today because there is a lot of capacity on the RACOT grid. We see most of the hours of the of the year. There's plenty of capacity for growth to connect. So we want to optimize bringing resources into that while the grid is upgraded and infrastructure is built. So one of the key one of the key issues that we deal with and that we're having to address is a fact that transmission when it gets when a study is done with regards to the transmission capacity for a project to connect when that study is completed. And then the project is ready to begin moving forward with signing power contracts and developing their assets. Veterans mission capacity does not get reserved or committed for that resource. Our current process effectively studies the system as it is that point in time and with the known developments that are in front of us. But then because of the changes that we're seeing that are so significant that the volume being so high within three six months. The circumstances at that approved location on the grid at a future point in time now is different. And so without holding that capacity for a project what can happen is over time. Pancaking projects in the similar areas of the grid are creating a need to go back, re-study and re-confirm, re-evaluate the capability to serve those loads. Introducing uncertainty and a lack of clarity as to where a customer actually is in the process. And so when you consider the size, the volume, the dollars that are being invested in these kinds of projects, it's really an untenable process to continue with that approach. So that's one of the key issues. I think of it almost a little bit like a restaurant analogy where somebody calls or caught the restaurant and says, you know, we're going to come tonight for dinner at seven o'clock. And we say great, we've got a table available. But then between now and seven o'clock, 10 other people come in because we don't have a reservation system and the tables are gone. And so that's effectively the way the transmission study process works today. There is no commitment or holding of that reservation effectively for the customer. So where we think we need to go in order to deal with this is looking at a process that we're calling a batch process. And a batch effectively is going to be in a group of projects that are ready to be studied. We'll all get studied together. And then that established set of results in terms of the transmission needs and capacity to serve those will be essentially locked in for that group of customers. And that'll create a foundation and a baseline for building forward the next batch that would occur. We need to start with a batch zero concept in order to begin this process because we have a lot of projects that are in the queue today. And we need to establish that first set foundation that we can then hold and commit that transmission for all of those projects. And then in each subsequent batch, we would then build on the assumptions that have changed between now and then, which includes added infrastructure as well as added loads. And so we think that a batch process would best serve and be able to support getting clarity and transparency to developers as well as to transmission operators and other stakeholders in the state as to how we can support and serve the growth that's coming our way. We think timing is a really important part of this. And so there's clearly a pressure to move quickly and support the economic growth that's coming our way. And so we would propose to try to set up this batch zero construct sometime in the first quarter of 2026 if possible so that we can get that that foundational establishment of projects and the transmission that there's going to be committed to serve them so that then subsequent projects can be evaluated against that. So we're going to have to work on which I think is going to be one of the more complex elements of this is establishing what's the criteria for inclusion into that batch. And so we're going to have to look at characteristics of the projects as they are underway today, determine which ones have the highest likelihood of developing because again we're committing transmission capacity. So we only want to study and hold capacity for people that are actually going to show up at the restaurant for dinner, not those that are just thinking maybe they want to come or maybe they don't. And so that's a really important criteria for the first step as well as subsequent steps. We could be looking at criteria that includes financial security in order to show the seriousness of the development. We could be looking at criteria that looks at the progress that these projects have already made ownership of land procurement of materials. Various things that we could look at over the next few months to come up with a set of criteria, but I think that's going to be one of the key steps that we're going to have to work through and get stakeholder input into how to do that best. So people would be to run a batch study more than once a year. So ideally a couple times a year we'd be able to do this reflecting planned changes throughout the year because this is a very dynamic process. And in each batch study, the circumstances and the forecasts are going to likely get updated based on infrastructure development, generation, transmission both as well as expectations around large loads. And then lastly, there's been there's a lot more in between, but another consideration to be thinking about is that when we commit capacity on the transmission system for a project, we're going to need to think through a set of milestones that will help us hold that capacity for the time that the project is built. There will be a queue of projects behind that very many will be serious and ready to develop, but are just needing the transmission capacity to do so. So if a project gets approved and transmission is held for them, if they don't progress along some set of milestones or timetable, there needs to be a process to reclaim that transmission and included back into a subsequent batch. So that other legitimate projects have an opportunity to develop and this is that optimization process where we're allocating the transmission capacity, optimizing it as things change and all of this in this period of time, I think three to five years or so until significant infrastructure that's being planned today gets built and we're in a position where we can better serve this load without having this kind of complex interim by processing place. There are a lot of moving parts with all of this. There is the rulemaking's associated with Senate Bill six that has elements around defining the large load forecast criteria. It also has elements of defining a connection standard for large loads, both of which I think will be important and part of this interconnection process. We're going to be looking at modifying our current interconnection process and adapting what we have today with picker 115 into what this new process will be. We have established a project. We think this has so many moving parts that we want to define a project to really help with organizing and communicating what we are doing and so that all stakeholders have visibility to and there's transparency on the decisions, the issues, the milestones and the progress points as we move forward. We've retained McKenzie to help us with that program management of that project overall. They're going to help work with the work that's going to be between Irkhat and the stakeholders to ensure that we have adequate communications and adequate processes in place in order to have a very clear path to work in this project, this project forward. I want to emphasize input from all of the stakeholders that are impacted by this is going to be critical to doing this accurately and also to be doing it quickly. We believe strongly that that's going to be an important part of this overall project. We need to balance the ability to get that input quickly but then come up with a process quickly enough that meets the needs of the economic growth here in the state of Texas. That's how we're thinking about stepping forward and I'll pause there and if there's any questions or any other comments from my colleagues. Chad, see you later, Irkhat. I think, probably, now, what we're thinking about as far as the batch study process, maybe I'll talk a little bit more about the timeline on what we're thinking. As Pablo indicated, we want to try to be in a position in Q1 with the batch study zero as the base case. How that's going to look as far as engagement with the stakeholders is that we'll be focusing talking to the utilities and the large load customers first to understand all the issues and concerns that they have. At the same time in parallel internally, we've got a group of subject matter experts that'll be working to put together the framework for the batch study process. We envision this playing out of the next six to eight weeks. We'll tend to send out a market notice either Monday or Tuesday and it lays out the communication expectation and how we're going to engage the stakeholders will leverage the large load working group as a forum to go and check in and let everybody know will leverage tack to give updates. We're obviously come back to the commission at the January open meetings, all targeting to come with a proposal of what the batch study framework would look like in the February timeframe. So as Pablo indicated, it is important to gauge all the stakeholders. Our first priority will be those utilities and large load customers. There may be more one on ones with those type of stakeholders and then kind of broader group discussions as we move down and talk to the generators, the retail providers to see how we can get additional input. So these would kind of parallel tracks of talking to the stakeholders, but also developing the framework and the input from the stakeholders will feed into our framework ultimately into what we propose to the commission in the February timeframe. I'll turn over to Woody to see if he wants to have anything else. Yeah, I don't have anything else to add. All right, again, thanks for being here. Thanks for that layout. I want to also thank you. You know, I started talking with you all about this in earnest back in September. I think I at that point referenced there were two main issues, kind of foundational issues. I thought we had to address one was what is legitimate load that's coming onto the system. And then once we know what those loads are and they go through the process, they have to have some sense that the the amount of capacity they need will be there. And so I think that this process at a very high level into your point, Pablo, there's a lot to fill in. Needs both of those. I think that's a very aggressive timeline. We do we do need to be aggressive in our timeline. I think to stick to that, obviously communications going to be key on this. As we work through it, I've talked to barkstale and I think we're going to open a project to focus on this and commissioners. I'm going to ask that that just be put as a standing item on the agenda because depending on kind of where these discussions go, I think we may need to have a lot of conversations and open meetings just so we're fully transparent on what this looks like, especially as we're heading into this is Pablo termed batch zero. So I just want to make sure that everyone understands we're going to be transparent in this and talk about it openly. But I think that on those two elements that I identified back in September that we need to address in this process. I think this is getting us towards that. So I want to thank you for that. And I have some other comments, but I want to make sure I open it up to you all if you have any questions for Pablo or the team or any thoughts. I was just going to say I appreciate the thoroughness and expediency that you guys have worked on this. It's really nice to know. Well, I had a bunch of questions on what was filed, but I guess we'll focus on what you just said and said, do you plan on filing something to that extent for us to follow along with in the near future? It was a lot. I think that's tried to take notes as you went along, but it's easier if we have something to follow in paper too, obviously. Yes, as Chairman indicated, we'll come in every open meeting and we'll have content to provide to the commission as we're moving this forward. I mean, ultimately when we get to the February timeframe, we would file the batch study proposal. And that may be more focused on batch zero. And it may as we continue to look for kind of what a study state solution will look like. The issue becomes from a regulatory perspective. How do you implement that? Well, we'll be able to highlight our thoughts around how we can implement that because as indicated in the filing on Monday, the planning guide revision request 115 is the current law for how the large load interconnection study process works. So we'll need to work with the commission on how we go about effectuating this new batch study process knowing that the planning guide is the law right now that we have to adhere to. So I went through kind of what you did file. I was created a chart to see, you know, is it hitting where the bottlenecks that we've talked about extensively with you and Dan, if you're solving for them? And I think the batch study does sound like that will help a good bit. You mentioned the idea of, you know, we've always said open access. Well, you know, we are we don't reserve. We grid and manage the grid just as it comes. And now we're talking about reserving in pure. We do talk about open access and that is something that specific does that run into any issues there with what a transmission company has as they are required to be open access. So from our perspective, we don't think it does counter the open access requirement for the operation of our grid because anybody is eligible to come in and solicit the access to that transmission. What we're really talking about is it's open access to available transmission. We have situations today when somebody comes in and they're looking to connect at a specific site on the grid. There isn't adequate capacity at that point in time. So they're told they have to wait until infrastructure upgrades are made in order to be able to connect and energize at a level. This is a very similar concept where we're saying, you know, where anybody can come in. There is no discrimination on who is eligible to do so, but there has to be available capacity for them. And so it's really open access to all available capacity that's on the system versus not not letting people double double commit sections of the grid, which then creates, I think a bigger problem. I think the analogy of a restaurant that you know that's very helpful to kind of think through and you know maybe we're just so popular now that we have to start having a reservation system. But it's still everyone can try to make that reservation is what we need to keep in mind. Is there anything else in our statutes or that we need to keep and be mindful of what we need to stay in the parameters of and or change that you all thought forward on? From statutory perspective, not right now, but we'll obviously be looking at the regulatory construct of how we implement this and it's probably indicating you have two rule makings that are in various processes right now, the largely forecasting interconnection standard. We want to be obviously cognizant of that work with commission staff, particularly on the interconnection standard rule, which will I believe will go out for publications sometime in January, because that could be an opportunity to fill in some of the gaps as far as this process leveraging that interconnection standard rulemaking process. But when we make the filing in February, we will obviously speak to kind of the regulatory requirements on where we think we need to highlight opportunities to move forward to implement this process. Commissioner Yalman, if I can add on to that, I think commission staff part of our role in this process is going to be to be highly coordinated with our COTS staff, but also to be thinking about the regulatory and legal frameworks around all of this interim process development. So that by the time the idea is more fully baked, we have a plan on how to move forward within the framework of the statutes and our rules to keep everybody on safe ground. And just if you don't mind chairman, I just want to announce the project number for this will be 5 9 1 4 2. We just opened it yesterday afternoon, so we'll expect filings to go there related to this project. 5 9 1 4 2 5 9 1 4 2. And before we move on, Barksdale, I also want to take this opportunity is I've been thinking through this over the last couple of months. You've been the person I've leaned on the most to think through what this needs to look like, so I want to say thank you for working through this with me. It's one of the most important things we're going to work on going into 2026 and throughout the year. And it's been extremely helpful to me to be able to use you as a sounding board for the ideas that I have and I appreciate it. I think you've helped us get to the point that we're at and it's much appreciated. That's very generous sir. Thank you. Another comment I was just going to make is to ask for in the docket at some point some type of procedural schedule just for expectations and deadlines. For clarity, we had the interim process. We have figure one one five. This new interim process will be in February or the end of January. In February, we will provide the commission the framework for the batch study process and then there's a discussion about how quickly can we implement it? Okay. So because again, figure one 15 is the current law. So I need to think through how can we move forward expeditiously to implement this batch study process? What does that look like? Does that attach itself to a rulemaking? A ways to do that is there a way to, you know, for ERCOT to seek a good cause exception for the areas that we need relief from the commission under the figure one 15 process. So those are the type of regulatory framework issues that we would highlight in the filing in February to have that discussion with the commission. Yeah, in commission, I would say, you know, as I've talked to them about this, you know, the idea of being very expeditious and coming up with what this may look like is they and their consultant or staff engage with the market participants. But ultimately the decision on how and what and when to implement this will be here. And are the other rules that we had going now moving into that one that you just listed? No, ma'am, they will stay in their own control numbers as they've already been published and any project, any rulemaking that's still kind of in the scoping and discussion draft phase, they will stay separated out there. We want to make sure that first of all, we're doing things in accordance with the the APA, but also just to make sure that we're keeping concepts clear between what future rulemaking looks like and how to integrate any interim process that gets developed as part of this clustering batching project. And then one final thing and then I promise one item that has continually come up has been communication between TSP's the loads and obviously our caught where or what are y'all working on to help in that segment of the problem. So yeah, we do what he ricker some with our car. Yeah, we do think that we need that more direct line of communication with these large loads. That is that will greatly make this whole process go like it needs to go. I think that's one of the things that's hindered us so far is the kind of the phone tag that we have to play through through TSP's and TSP's back to us and the loads. It's just a it's not a good good direct line of communication and I think for this to be successful, we'll have to have good communication and really good expectations on on what the requirements are for being included in these batches and have it public and everyone see it and understand it and debate it and talk about it. And having those two things I think will give us some success here because this is a big change. This is very different than anything we've done before. We've always had a margin of a top of the grid that we could install new load and that this that is no longer there and these new loads are are already eaten through that margin and this is this change is something that we've never really had to have before. Even two years ago we didn't expect needing this change. Yeah, and I would say also as we're endeavoring to come up with this process, you know, one of the reasons I was supportive of the McKinsey contract is their program oversight of this. A large part of that will be coordinate communication and bringing parties together or caught TSP's large loads, other interested parties. And so that that'll be a large part of their work will be bringing those groups together to make sure there's communication coordination. We're also going to leverage existing venues that we have like the large load working group, the tech process where all of the stakeholders have an opportunity to participate. In addition to kind of project specific communications that we're going to make in order to keep everybody plugged in while we move through this. Thank you. I think on the data sharing and the communication piece, I think it's going to be very important that we are very direct and very explicit about the type of information that we need particularly from the large loads. And I know oftentimes, you know, when you when you're managing change your first inclination is sometimes to collect any and all data that's available. And sometimes, you know, particularly if you're a very short timeline and you've got a very specific objective that you're trying to meet, it's important at the front end to really spend some time and figure out what is that data and information that I truly need to meet those objectives. And so I know we spent a lot of time talking about the need to communicate with the large loads, but we need to provide that very explicit ask, I think to them, as well as get their input and engagement because I think that that's going to be the key as we kind of study this moving forward. I really appreciate your work on this. And I think this approach that we're looking at this cluster approach is one that that sounds like it's going to bring some fruitful results. I know that there are many levels in this process. And so I know we're talking about, you know, the ERCOT piece of it, but there are also other things that are ongoing in the transmission planning process that reside, you know, with the transmission providers. So, you know, hopefully, you know, the best outcome in the long term would be that this becomes more like one large process as opposed to many separate different processes. So I'll be anxious to kind of follow the progress as we move forward and to kind of see hopefully the information that you're sharing isn't a format that is easy for, you know, the public and for the commission to understand. I'm a big advocate of flow diagrams. So I think to the extent that you could include those and in your workflow process, I think that would be helpful. And again, just appreciate your work on this. And I think, you know, what they've laid out makes a lot of sense. So I think the last thing I would say is again, appreciate all the work. You know, probably you brought up Senate Bill 6. I do want to make it clear this is not going to be a form to relitigate what ended up in Senate Bill 6. We're going to work this process through the parameters laid out in statute, including Senate Bill 6. So please don't spend a lot of energy relitigating the issues we spent last session discussing. You know, I think the other thing and we talked briefly about this earlier this week is how this process will kind of align with already existing processes, you know, the load forecast from the TDUs, the RTP RPG process, how this may impact capacity for loads below 75 MW, you know, I think oil and gas and things of that nature. And so I think again, we're going to try to get some answers. There's also going to be a lot of questions that pop up because this is going to be a new process, trying to solve a specific issue that will raise other issues that we'll have to deal with. But the commitment from this commission and from our cadets will be communicative about this. We will talk about it publicly. We will do our best to address every issue as we endeavor to find a solution to this because we want these loads here. We want to figure out a way to do this in a managed way that doesn't impair reliability. And I think we're up to the task and we'll accomplish that. So commissioners, if you all have anything else, Paul, again, I want thank you for being here. Chad and Woody for answering questions and laying this out and more to come. Thank you, thank you commissioner. All right. So we have an RTC plus B update Keith. Good morning. Good morning. Keith Collins or caught. I'm here to provide you an update on the RTC B implementation that occurred on December 5th. Overall, we view it as a successful implementation. We have obviously culminated the effort of several years of efforts, both at Irkott at the commission and elsewhere. And ultimately the transition that did occur the week of December 1st of leading up to the fourth and the fifth. It was a smooth transition overall. There were items that our staff and participants had to work through, but nothing that we hadn't planned for and were able to address expeditiously. There were items such as some price corrections that have been done, but again, these were instances where we were able to flag them quickly and make software changes to correct any issues. Thinking about the period of how the market has worked since then, there were some changes in participant behavior that we identified, particularly as it related to energy storage resources. Although one of the things I would note is that some of these behaviors seem to be transitory in the sense that the behavior on one day does not sustain over a period of several days. We've seen changes over the past several days. And so the way we view this is as a period of transition as the participants begin to stabilize their strategies in the new market. Ultimately, the initial behaviors and the results have been favorable. And ultimately the cold snap that we saw earlier this week was a good test period for the co optimization and the use of the Anzli Service Demankerfs. And we believe that they were successful and the potential savings of that are substantial. We're working to quantify what those savings are. And hopefully in the coming weeks we'll be able to identify explicitly what we believe the savings to be from the RTC plus B over the last several days and weeks. Going forward, we will continue our stabilization efforts. There are items that we had identified before go live that would be addressed after go live. We have been working on those with prioritization going to ones that would have led to potential protocol issues. Many of those have been addressed and we anticipate having those all addressed by by the January timeframe. There are other items that we expect reports and things along that nature that are going to be completed over the coming months, which was to be expected anticipated as part of our stabilization efforts. And so those are ongoing. And then the final comment I'm going to make is with regards to some of the market design and analysis that we were we had discussed throughout the stakeholder processes follow up. We do anticipate beginning stakeholder discussions early next year about potential modifications or enhancements in the in the ASDC process. And as well as evaluating the performance of things such as the duration requirements that were discussed late last year. So there is more work to be done, but the primary implementation was a success and we look forward to moving forward. Thank you. Thanks Keith. Commissioners questions. Great work. I know it was a long time coming. So congratulations for everyone on the team. I guess maybe if not the number one thing, it was pretty close and so appreciates the work on this. I know that we talked about that there was going to be this transit or period. And I guess we're hopeful that that is short so that we'll have a good feel for what that baseline is for the next round of changes that we're going to be working on because the thought was again, let's get RTC plus B in place first. And then we'll move on to these other opportunities. So looking forward to see, you know, that kind of like what that break point is. And then also the benefits that you're going to be reporting associated with it. Keith, thank you for touching on kind of the energy storage resource behavior that first day. I know that led to some what I saw some lively conversations between maybe the IMM and some of the energy storage resources online. And I think points to why you don't look at a small sample size to know what behavior is truly going to be. But I think as we have a longer period of evaluation for this, seeing what behavior from different resources really is and how it's impacted by RTC plus B. And I know Jeff's here hearing from the IMM as well about what they're saying. I think will be really important as we analyze the impact of RTC plus B. So appreciate you touching on that this morning. Thank you. Thanks Keith. All right, commissioners, that'll take us them back up to the top two item number six. That is 5, 8, 391 implementation of SB 740 system improvement charge. And Commissioner Yaltman, you filed a memo in this project. I did. I just wanted to obviously we had some cases that dealt with this. And since the rule is still pending, I wanted to make some suggestions to staff and stakeholders to kind of consider and keep in mind. My memo lays out. I think some things that are worth considering as regards to timelines and effective dates. Obviously the statute was changed and some of the effective dates are now currently in place and some are in the future, which is causing a little bit of problems. So in particular, if we can just keep some of that in mind as we're looking at the rule in regards to the deadlines. And we might want to consider some temporary provisions to put in place until they are all on the same time schedule. I don't have language or anything like that. I just want to have staff make note of some of the proceedings that have occurred and keep that in mind for the rulemaking coming forward. This is a McKinsey Arthur for Commission staff. The proposal for publication is still open for comment and we have initial comments to do at the end of the week. But we also have reply comments to do in the middle of January. So responses to the memo could be incorporated in the reply comments by stakeholders. Oh, yeah, that's a good idea. Thank you for that, Mack. Commissioner's anything else? All right. Thanks, Joel. All right. Next up is item number 11. That is project number 58210 review of section 25.235 through 237 interim fuel adjustments for utilities outside of our cut proposal for adoption. This is a staff's second recommendation for adoption. Yeah, this is David Gordon commission staff. Commission staff has offered a second recommended proposal for adoption for your consideration to implement house built 2073 and make other adjustments to our current fuel reconciliation and fuel adjustment rules. So maybe just briefly one I want to say appreciate all the work that was done in the intervening period between when you first brought this up and we asked to kind of work with the outside of our cut utilities. There was a filing made close to five o'clock yesterday about one specific issue. So I thought maybe if you could talk through that issue and why you think the policy in the rule as proposed for adoption is the right policy. Chairman Glistner, when you say that are you talking about the issue of off system sales? That's correct. Yes, so as I mentioned, this rulemaking is open to implement house bill 2073, but when we did that, we also wanted to consider other portions of our fuel reconciliation and fuel factor proceedings. So if there's areas to improve, we'll go ahead and do that. How about this? Mr. Gordon, I will just take a moment to mention and this could for everyone. The microphones are not as sensitive as they initially were. They had to turn them down so that to reduce the feedback. So speaking closer to the mic is helpful. Thank you Sheila. So in the proposal for publication, we asked a question about off system sales and whether or not we should maintain that regime. And we got comments back from interested persons who said that the off system sales regime is a little bit antiquated and no longer reflects how the non-erot cut utilities are making sales because they now operate in centralized markets. For that reason, we offered some suggestions in our first recommended proposal for adoption that would limit the instances in which those utilities could retain off system sales. We deliberated that after the first recommendation after having some discussions internally. And we decided to make a further adjustment, which would be that the utility can keep off system sales so long as they show that the sale would benefit the customers and be in the public interest. And this is consistent with the fundamental principle of rate regulated utilities being authorized to earn revenues so long as they can show that it provides benefit to their customers and maintains their financial health. So we signaled in our proposal for adoption that this is an item that's worthy of future consideration. We hope to take that up in a separate rulemaking. But for now, we think that this strikes the right balance between allowing the utility to maintain some of those off system sales, but also show why it's necessary to serve their customers and why it's in the public interest to do that. So again, no prohibition just a requirement to show it benefits customers and is in the public interest. That's correct, Chairman. Commissioner, is there any questions? Thank you. Okay, with that, I'll entertain a motion to approve the proposal for adoption. So moved. Second. A motion to second. All those in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed? Motion prevails. Thanks, she'll. All right, that'll take us then to item number 12. That's project number 58555, Irkott, Antlerian Reliability Services, Cost Allocation Study, pursuant to purist section 39.1593. Morning, Julie. Morning, Harke. Good morning. I'm Julie Galdon for staff. Last week commission filed, excuse me, last week staff filed a draft scope document for this project. Staff is requesting commission provide its final input on the study scope. No later than the January 15th, 2026 open meeting in order to keep this project on schedule for the final deadline. By December 1st, 2026, the commission must evaluate and report to the legislature on aspects of the cost allocation of ancillary and reliability services in Irkott. Staff's draft study scope document describes the cost allocation methods to be studied, the analytical approach, and the anticipated project schedule. Staff created the scope with input from Irkott staff, IMM staff and market participants. We appreciate this collaboration. Again, staff requests the commission provide its final input on the study scope by the January 15th, 2026 open meeting in order to keep the project on schedule for a timely delivery to the legislature. And I'm happy to answer any questions on any aspects of the scope or on the project as a whole. Thank you, Julie. Harke, did you have any, then you wanted to say no? I appreciate the scoping document. I think it gives us a good foundation to make a decision at the January open meeting commissioners questions. Julia Harke. Just one clarification. Is this a one time study or multiple years in the making one time? I thought the scope was very comprehensive and look forward to hearing any comments and seniors or something that we need to add in addition to what you have here. Thank you. I'm sure if anyone has anything to say we'll hear about between now and the 15th. Thank you both. Thank you for all the work on this. A big endeavor and appreciate like I said the scoping document is super helpful. Thank you. Thank you very much. All right item 13 is project number 58777 triennial reliability assessment for the ERCOT region under section 25.508. Appreciate the use of the word triennial. Thank you. As opposed to triennial. Which would be very different sir. Yes sir. Remember has it this is the first time that we've ever used the word triennial in projects styling. All right. We like first times. So yeah. Harika Basaran commission staff. So next year we will be very busy and the purpose of this memo is really to set up framework for you and you tell us. What you like in the memo what you don't like so we have a very transparent and clear robust road map. The first section is really about the dates. Our rule has certain milestones we need to achieve in order to finish this assessment by the end of the year. So the milestone number one milestone is assumptions approval and ERCOT is expected to file mid January. Then staff will provide some questions for comments with getting feedback from each office and then comments will be do 30 days early March. And then ERCOT after feedback from the stakeholder they will file their final recommended assumptions. And then after that staff will file its recommended assumptions and then we are giving you two open meetings April 17 but no later than May 7 open meeting to approve the assumption. So that's the big first milestone. Do you have any questions on that milestone or to ERCOT? No. The second phase is going to be ERCOT's assessment. They need to take this approved assumptions and load it in the server model and they will do that work. And by the mid August they said they can come and they can file their final assessment including market design options if needed. But they also promise during that assessment they will be happy to provide updates to PUC and SAC. So that's the second phase. So Harka real quick on that I just want to make sure so when they are finished with their assessment they'll have the latitude to offer up any market design changes that they think would be helpful to meeting our standard. Yes, absolutely. The rule requires them to provide. Okay, perfect. Thank you. As well as they'll have to provide one that they're recommending. Yes, absolutely. The third phase will be IMM and stakeholder review after ERCOT files their final recommendations begin again. We are going to ask some comments on that. Ask some questions and then IMM will by rule they are required to file their assessment of the ERCOT's recommended market design options. And then the only thing we want to change is we discussed during briefings September 28 IMM evaluation to you. We just want to give stakeholders and ERCOT also react to IMM's assessment. So we may put another comments period for the stakeholders and ERCOT early October. So then you will have all the opinions. And then we enter the final phase commission review. We are planning to do a workshop in mid October and then early November staff will bring and during the time we will be communicating with each of you. Absolutely. We will be bringing you staff final recommendations and then you will take all the open meetings. Sheila set up in November and December next year to decide. So the goal is to finish it by the end of the next year, but there is no requirement to finish it by then. So we are just coming with this proposal for you to a panel. Thank you, Harcett. It's well thought out. I think it's really good. Appreciate the additional step being added for responses to IMM's analysis. I think that's a good addition and change to the process commissioners questions. I do the items. So I think it was last year when we were talking through this about how it would work. You identified this assessment as the opportunity to analyze revenue sufficiency and incentivize dispatchable generation, which I understand would be part of if we're meeting our reliability standard or not. But if we're meeting the standard, we still be able to show and provide data to say like here is where the incentivization of generation and thermal dispatchable is happening or not. I think in the AST, you brought up that and we promised you to make that part of the process. Okay, perfect. And then the other item just to make note of when options are brought forth from our condor stakeholders, I want to emphasize the S on options. Many not just one I want to have a little picking and choosing to what we can do and play with. Absolutely. Thank you very good feedback for us. And then the second part of memo, we just really highlight certain big policy items currently at the stakeholder process or what staff's thinking. One of them is really cone. A cos of new entry, but we really, Urkath came up with a very good proposal to handle that. We need to update cone because of the inflation and supply chain issues. And I think Urkath really has a good plan and they will submit that plan in January with the other assumptions. So you will have another opportunity to apply on that plan. But really think a good cone is very important. The second one is the RRS. As you know in the AST study, commission also asks for some optionality. It can be used for a resource adequacy tools and Urkath filed 1310. So we just want to highlight that the RRS will be also discussed heavily during this process. And we are just asking how much do you want that discussion to be part of the reliability standard at the commission. We are just looking for feedback. Another issue is participation of energy storage resources in the DRRS. So if you want to opine on that and if you want staff to make that part of the questions, we just need your feedback. And the final one is really what are other market design changes. Again, this is not a complete list. However, what staff is thinking, what behave in our rules and in the protocols, what we did in the past. And these are the options we are just providing you. And I think some of them is already Urkath working on that in the stakeholder process. So this is really all we have. So we just want you to tell us how do you want us to be involved in this process, which is going to last all next year. So we can plan. Yeah, you know as far as questions to ask, I'm always in favor of ask the question, get the feedback. So I think when it comes to the RRS, ask all the questions, ask about batteries, ask, you know, we need to vet that. That new Ancillary Service, the DRRS, we need to vet those comprehensively and fully. And so I think any questions you have put them out, see what the responses are so that we have as full information as possible as we're making our decisions. Anything else? And I think it's likely not one option. It could very well be a combination of options. And so to the extent that we can evaluate, you know, the options, you know, somewhat independently so that, you know, maybe two aren't tied together so that we'll have, you know, the information we need in the data we need. If we move down the path of selecting several in combination as opposed to just one or two. Thank you. That's all I have. Thank you, Arca. Thank you. Item 14 is project number 5-8198. Rulemaking to implement firming reliability requirements for electric generating facilities in the Irkut region under pure section 39.1592. Jesse and Warner. Good morning. Yeah. So real quick and commissioning all of them and you follow the memo in this. How do you want to lay out your memo first? You want them to lay out the rule? Happy for them to lay out the rule. So Jesse Horn for commission staff with me is Warner Roth and Irkut representatives are also here to answer any questions that you have. Overall, I'm supportive of the PFA. Just want to start with that. I think that you all done a great job of balancing the feedback from stakeholders and everyone. And I do lay out in my memo one change that I think would be needed to be made and then made and then I would like to discuss and have some questions on having large load or loads participate as a firming resource. I know staff did make comments regarding where and why that came from in regards to resource. I understand that thought process. However, I will just be honest when I thought of this rule having load be a firming resource was never something I even contemplated. So it is a very new idea for me to come up to. And so I just thought it would be wise to kind of discuss that more amongst ourselves. And just so I can better understand it. And then if Irkut is here to discuss, I'm curious to see how and if they are able to collect that data and guarantee that load can be there during these low operating hours. And if that's something they've done before. So I'm not sure if anyone from Irkut can answer thAcker not. But I'll start with that and see what feedback they have. My name is Austin Rosell from Irkut. Yes, so for in regards to validating, I guess measuring the performance of load resources. We do think we have the data to do that. We do think that's not overly complicated. It's very similar to currently as we envision it, we see it being very similar to how we would evaluate generation resources. So we do have like the MPC net power consumption for these load resources. That could be analogous to the HSL for generation resources that we're going to use to evaluate generation resource performance. So we do currently have that data flowing into our system and we would use that to that would be basically the measurement of the available availability of the load resource, right? The megawatts available. There will be some slight differences, right? Like for the generation resource, you know, the HSL is the full capability for a load resource. They can't drop their load down to zero necessarily, but we also have a value called the LPC, the low power consumption. So the difference of those two, that's the amount of the load resource could drop and not a megawatts. They could stop consuming to open up to the grid to allow you know generation to serve other loads. So yeah, and in short, I think we have the technical capability and that's that's our thinking on how we would measure that. There's there'll be some more doubles in the details and the protocols, obviously. If these load resources do get ancillary service deployments, we need to take that into account because that will change their net power consumption. So we need to add that back in. But other than that, it does, it does seem fairly straightforward the way we're envisioning it now. But you would not need you think you have the necessary resources to be able to do this. Okay, okay. And is there anything else we need to consider in this first staff as well with SB6 and the load firming that is included in that and having this be in firming, well not load firming. Sorry, low shed and whatnot in SB6. Is there anything to consider in regards to how that would work? So we discussed your memo last night. We don't see a lot of overlap in the resources that would be in the entities, the assets that be affected by SB6. We don't think that those would be registered as controllable load resources or non-controllable lead road resources, which are the only ones eligible for the firming rule as we didn't see any overlap there. That's helpful. I'm happy to discuss further. Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, and staff answered my, you know, these resources provide to let me tree you have the data you need for them provides optionality for the firming. So I think if your questions got answered, you know, I think where I said I'm good with the with the PFA language, including this. I don't know if you'd be helpful to hear. I know where you kind of talked about it last time why you thought this was the right policy, but if you want to go over that again. Sure thing. I'm Warner Roth for commission staff. So in the original PFP, we did limit this just to the resources that are listed out explicitly in the statute. As was pointed out by multiple parties when they filed comments, the statute says the requirements on the electric duration facilities, but the firming can be satisfied by resources. And so we wanted to make sure we were as inclusive with what resources could be contributing to that firming as possible. We spoke with Irkott on quite a few meetings. And this was one of the topics that came up and what resources can you verify the firming? What do you have the telemetry for, etc. And load resources, one of the resources that as they just confirm here as well, they would be able to confirm that this was providing the firming that they said they were. That's what we included them. Again, I'm supportive. I appreciate your memo and you calling this out last open being because I definitely think for a change like this, it deserved to have a broader discussion. I appreciate you bringing that kind of to the forefront. But again, I'm comfortable with it. I don't know what our biosus feelings are. I just had one more question for Irkott and it really kind of revolves around, you know, there are things that you can do and actions you can take, where you can go back after the fact. And determine how the resource performed. But there's also a consideration, I think, from an operations standpoint. I mean, so do we feel from Irkott standpoint comfortable in real time this being an avenue that can actually firm up the needs of the grid. So no concerns with actually executing and doing it during real time versus, you know, having this resource available for firming and and I guess from a from a paper standpoint. No, I'm not aware of any concerns. The market systems will run as designed. There's really no interference in how the market systems run based on these changes. These are, this is an economic incentive to have resources firm up in advance with a settlement after the fact. So I don't think there's really any real time operators aren't doing anything different. The markets are running as the market is accustomed to, although we're still settling in on RTC. No concerns. Commissioner Yalmond, do you want to go over your other change in your memo? Oh, sure. It is. Let me pull up the memo. I believe it was there was a word included in statute that are in the rule that we will be removing. Yes, it does not need to include. It's a small change. Right. So maybe more did thoughts on this change as well. Yes, so what about the commission staff? Yes, um, this is a discussion that came up in briefings this week and there was a concern around a disconnect between an energy storage resources, which is HSL and its state of charge and how a situation could possibly rise where a energy storage resource with zero state of charge could still be showing a fully available HSL. Obviously, if we're trying to have a resource provide firming to the system, we want to ensure that it's capable of doing so. And so the recommendation to allow for this to be worked out in the stakeholder process and through the recode protocols was to instead of just focusing on the verification for distribution energy storage resources have this encompass all energy storage resources. Okay, good. I think that's a good change. Okay, y'all have anything else? Okay. I'm happy to make the motion check. All right. Well, I will entertain a motion to approve the proposal for adoption as modified by Commissioner Yaltman's memo in our discussion. Second motion a second. All those in favor say aye. Opposed motion prevails. Thank you, Jesse. Thank you, Warner. All right, item 17 is project number 58492. Texas Energy Fund grants for facilities outside of the Irkott region reports and filings. Good morning. Good morning, Chairman commissioners. John Elmdard for staff. Staff recommends selection of six applicants and 14 projects for the Texas Energy Fund outside Irkott grant program totaling $282,210,000 and benefiting 933,627 customers. Staff further requests that authority be delegated to the executive director to enter into your grant agreement with selected applicants and projects has indicated in the memo in draft order. The projects which address reliability and resiliency and facility authorization objectives have been selected for investment after undergoing a compromise review. The staff review included ensuring administrative completeness and analysis of the project applicants, eligibility, technical attributes, cost reasonableness, know your customer review and assessing their ability to be able to complete the proposed project. Additionally, these projects have been determined to meet the program objectives and the policy priorities described in staff memo filed on August 20th. Thank you for that. Thank you for that. Again, as I said last time, I'm very encouraged by all the progress on this program. You all should be commended for how quickly we're doing this and the benefits that will, you know, the areas outside of Irkott will see from this. So kudos for all the work to get these projects going. And I'm supportive of these projects moving forward. Commissioner's thoughts or questions. Yeah, very supportive of these projects. I think the benefits here of reliability and resiliency. You know, one of them addresses weatherization very much needed by the customers, the consumers in these areas and it's a joint effort because the entities are taking on the operational. Cost and responsibilities. This will provide kind of if you will the initial capital. And so I think it's a good partnership. I think it's something that really addresses something that is is very much needed outside of Irkott and really commend you on, you know, the diligence in terms of looking at the projects and making sure that we're selecting ones that we know can be successfully executed and that we've got good partners that we're working with and helping these communities. To implement these projects and to to be able to promote resiliency and reliability. Thank you. All right. I'll entertain a motion to approve the proposed order. So moved. Second motion. Second. All those in favor say aye. Opposed? Motion prevails. All right. Item 18 is project number 59024. Texas Energy Fund. Texas backup power package program. Good morning. Good morning commissioners. Ramacing restogi for commission staff. Before you is a proposed rule to establish procedures to apply for a grant or loan to fund the Texas backup power packages. This rule will implement the fourth and last Texas energy fund programs and the fund size for this program is $1.8 billion. The backup power package grant and loan application process has two steps in the first step applicant eligibility is evaluated on the basis of services offered by the critical facility. The applicants control of the critical facility site. The geographic location and the applicant's ability to comply with the TPP or the Texas backup power package program performance requirements. In the second step, the Texas backup power package projects are evaluated eligible applicants receive a notice of eligibility and authorization to coordinate with an approved vendor to submit a TPP project. I want to note a few things in this rule making. First, staff has recommended in the proposed rule that the commission delegated authority to determine the eligibility of an applicant and award of a loan or grant to the executive director. Applications to this program could be in the thousands. So if we establish the correct policy framework, the commission could process these applications as we do other more routine matters. Second, the loans for this program are structured as forgivable loans. 100% of the loans are forgiven if the applicant complies with the performance requirements. In the event an applicant fails to comply with the performance requirements, the applicant may be required to pay back the full loan amount along with an accrued interest. I also want to note that backup power packages that source power from electric school buses are excluded from the scope of this rule making because of the technical and logistical complexities that are inherent to these assets. Staff has added a question to the proposal and invites comments from stakeholders related to integration of electric school buses in this program. So we can continue developing that aspect in the backup package program. With that, I'm here to answer any questions you all may have. Thank you, I'll have a commissioner's questions. Thank you all for working through this. I know it was the last one to get done. It's very excited. Thanks for working on this and I think you know one of the aspects that that we talked about was, you know, what are these systems going to look like? You've got a process in place here that will enable those who have been thinking about what this technology will look like to be able to access the forgivable loan as well as the grant money. You know a number of those technologies and ideas can be developed and presented so that may very well be. You know one of the greatest outcomes of this program is that we'll be prompting that type of technology and utilizing the resources of the grant program to get things kind of up and running. So thanks for working on this. I'm one of the things you talked about was applicants selecting from an approved vendor list. Can you just briefly talk through how that approved vendor list comes about? Yes, sure. So the approved vendor list is going to be prepared by the commission and the vendors are going to be selected through a competitive solicitation process. There will be an RFP that will be coming out soon after which would also have details about all of the technical specifications that you just spoke about commissioner Jackson that, you know, how are these packages going to look like? What is going to be the technical specifications for the packages? All of that is going to be part of that. Those vendors that we select that participate in that RFP process will be part of that approved vendor list and the eligible applicant or the critical facility that is applying for a grant or fund loan is going to be coordinating with that approved vendor to develop the TPP project. Perfect. Thank you. Commissioner is anything else? All right. I'll entertain a motion to approve the proposal for publication. So moved. Second. A motion to second. All those in favor say aye. Opposed? Motion prevails. She'll I'm looking at you. I think that takes us to the end of our projects and we do have a closed session. Right. So before we recess for closed session, just because I know a lot of people leave and maybe don't come back to the broadcaster in the room afterwards. It's been quite a year with a legislative session a lot coming out of it. I want to wish everybody a Merry Christmas. Happy holidays. Hopefully I know we have a lot going on. I know all of you all have a lot going on. Hopefully everyone gets a little break, a little vacation, some time for fun. Family and friends. Like I said, a lot of work has been done. We have a lot of work ahead of us in 2026. When I thank all the commissioners up here. For the support and all the work this this year, everyone in the audience and those listening, you know, this is a team effort and not just a PUC team, but an industry team, electric telecommunications and water. I think that's a united effort to get all these policies in place. And I appreciate all of you and all the efforts and a lot more to come in in 2026. And just special shout out to the Aggies and Red Raiders who are in the who Christmas comes a little early for us Aggies in the room on Saturdays. We take on Miami. If you're going to be in college station, I'll be there to reach out. Happy to have you hang out. There's room for all the long horns in the room. There's room on the bandwagon. How is Thanksgiving? Was it a good? It was great. We got because of Thanksgiving. We got a home game. So I appreciate your commissioners. So yeah, one more chance to lose. But yeah, there's no love. That's all right. I wore a broom for you. You did. I appreciate Connie. Thank you so much. I know how hard it is for you to put on that color. And I do appreciate it. And I do notice as I know as I work around, you know, I do notice it. But again, thank you for all the work. You know, as I as really as I think through all the progress made since 2021. The amount of work that's been done is really incredible. And I think everyone should be commended for everything that's happened. And I think all the three spaces that we have regulatory authority and oversight of. And so thank you. And with that, having convene in a duly noticed scope. Yes, ma'am. Before we adjourn in a less less reflective approach. I have a couple comments. If you all who have spent the last few months here and the last few decades here, take a good look around. At the hearing room because it will be doing a new year new me type thing over the holidays. You will find us for our January open meeting across the Capitol Mall in the Stephen F Austin building beyond the lookout for details as how to find that open meeting and attend it. And of course, will be available on Texas admin as well. So you will come back to a new commissioners hearing room in February of 26. Thank you for that. Connie, as we we work through last open meeting. The exact location that'll be posted on the agenda for that meeting.
