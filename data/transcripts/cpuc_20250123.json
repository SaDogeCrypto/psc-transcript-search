  "text": "Welcome to the public participation hearing being held today Thursday January 23rd, 2025, where we will take public input on California Water Service Company's General Rate Case. Judge Rose Haas, you may begin. Thank you, operator. The court reporters, please confirm if you are able to hear me and if you are ready. If your Honor, I can hear you and I'm ready to go. Thank you. We are on the record. The commission will come to order. Good afternoon. I am administrative large judge, Albert Barossas. And I am the administrative large judge assigned to this proceeding. Commissioner Matthew Baker is the PUC Commissioner assigned for this proceeding. And later this afternoon, he will provide a statement. This is the time and place for the public participation hearing for California Water Service Companies, General Rate Case, Application 24-07-003. This is a public participation hearing to take public comment on Cal Waters General Rate Case for years 2026, 2027, and 2028. A General Rate Case is commonly called a GRC. And in these types of cases, the California Public Utilities Commission takes a full look at utilities, capital additions, operating expenses, and other costs like labor, pension, and benefits, and taxes, as well as many other activities necessary to provide safe and reliable water service. And this application, Cal Water, requests the Commission's authority to increase rates for water service by 17.1% in test year 2026 to increase rates on January 1, 2027 by 7.7% and to increase rates on January 1, 2028 by 8.1%. Do those listening that wish to speak please call the member of the screen, that is 1,800 857 1917. Enter 603 2788 pound and press star 1 to alert the operator that you want to speak. I realize that not everyone is able to see what is being displayed on the screen for purposes of those who are calling only. I'm going to provide this information so you can walk you through to enable you to call even if you don't have visual access to the information that we are displaying on screen. Once you call in and follow the prompt information, please state your name, spell your last name and identify the specific service area you are calling about. If you are an elected official, in addition to stating your name, please provide your specific position or title. For those of you who are listening and are not certain whether you may wish to speak, we don't have to decide now, but at a certain moment I will tell you that please make your decision and press star 1 following the information on the screen and the full numbers of that I just gave you. The purpose of this public participation hearing is to hear directly from the public about how Waters General Ray case. During most of these hearings and these applications, the commission hears from the parties through official filings and comments made on the record during duly notice hearings. But this public participation hearing is the commission's opportunity to hear directly from you from members of the public. Before we proceed, I do want to take a moment to address the devastating wildfires that have been affecting parts of the Los Angeles area. I thought it was a remain with everyone who has been impacted by these fires, those who have lost homes, livelihoods and cherished memories, as well as the brave firefighters who continue to battle the flames under these incredibly challenging conditions. In light of this tragedy, I feel it's important to acknowledge that Cal Water does not provide water service to the communities within the boundaries of these current fires. Additionally, it is my understanding that no Cal Water customer service has been affected by these fires. However, I do want to extend my sentiments to anyone here today who may have been impacted by these fires either directly or indirectly, whether you are a Cal Water customer, the Cal Water employee, a representative of one of the parties in this proceeding, an employee of the California Public Utility Commission, or any other member of our California community. I recognize that you may have friends, family or loved ones who have been affected. The fires are not an issue in today's public participation hearing and have no bearing on this hearing and what is to be discussed as part of this proceeding. I felt it is important to pause and address this, not in my role as a judge, but as a human being in a fellow California. Together we are a resilient community and in times of hardship we come together to support one another. Thank you for allowing me to take this moment of reflection. On a related note, Cal Water has provided the public with information about the water company's efforts to prepare for a significant emergency like the LA fires, emergencies which could affect the water supply. If you would like to learn more information about Cal Water's emergency preparedness, you may visit the company's website at CalWater.com. Once on the Cal Water website, you will see several menu categories near the top of the screen. Place your cursor over the link title of customer care. Then click on the link title alert center. Then click on the link title information on Cal Water's emergency preparedness and LA fire relief efforts. There you will find information that was posted recently on January 15th. That will provide you with additional information. Thank you. Again, the focus of today's public participation hearing is to hear directly from the public about Cal Water's general rate case. But if you have specific questions regarding your bill or service, we will have Cal Water customer service representatives available to answer specific customer questions during the hearings. Additionally, if you have specific questions regarding your bill or specific questions, not necessarily regarding your bill, but perhaps about the application in this general rate case. There are representatives available to hear from you and answer questions. Not only during this public participation hearing, but also for some time thereafter. On the screen, you see information displayed, contact information, and phone numbers. You will see a phone number for Patrick Alexander. Phone number 408-367-8230. You also see names and phone numbers for customer service questions. One of those phone numbers is 530-433-6589. Another is 650-288-7875. Again, those last two numbers displayed on screen are in the event that you have questions regarding your bill or service, any customer service questions. I thank you for spending time with us this afternoon, whether you are sharing your thoughts on Cal Water's general rate case or whether you are simply listening. The Commissioner and I will be paying close attention to what you say. We also accept written public comments through a form on our website.

You will find a button titled Add Public Comment. If you click on that button and follow the directions, you will be able to submit your written public comment and this proceeding. As many of you are aware, the Public Utilities Commission has five commissioners who are appointed by the governor and confirmed by the state senate, including Commissioner Matthew Baker. At this moment, I am going to turn the floor over to Commissioner Baker. Commissioner Baker, the floor is yours. Yes. Thank you, Judge. Can you hear me? We can hear you loud and clear, Commissioner. Thank you. Excellent. I apologize for taking this upside of my office. I have two hearings today, three hearings today and one of them is in a different place. And I want to Acker everything that you said, Judge, regarding the fires in the LA region. And I don't think I can say it any better than you did. Thank you very much. I am the assigned commissioner for the California Water Company's General Rate Case Application 24-7-07-003, which requests the authority to increase rates for water services to approximately 500,000 plus active connections in California. In this application, California Water Company is requesting to increase customer collections by approximately $140 million across its rate-making regions in test year 2026 and increase collections elsewhere in its territory by approximately $8 million looking to adjust its capital structure and make other changes that will impact future-be-customer bills. As a commissioner on the California Public Utility Commission, I take all rate increases very, very seriously and the burden is on the utility to prove their case that these are just and reasonable rates. As I do for all general rate cases, I will evaluate this proposed rate increase by balancing the public interest through the lens of general affordability and maintaining safe and reliable utility service. I will be following today's discussions and public comments with great interest and I look forward to working with all of you as well as Judge Rosas on the issues that are raised in this application. I want to note for the people who are testifying, this is the beginning of the process, there will be testimony and other parties will have the opportunity to scrutinize all of the assertions and claims that the utility is making and this process which you can follow on our website if you so choose. I do want to end by thanking all the parties for their participation and I especially want to thank the people who are here today to submit their public comments on this proposed rate increase. With that, I would like to turn it back over to you, Judge. Thank you very much. Thank you Commissioner Baker. This moment we will now hear from the applicant, Cal Water. Patrick Alexander who is a general rate case manager with Cal Water will take one more than two minutes to make a presentation. Mr. Alexander, whenever you are ready, the floor is yours. Thank you, Your Honor. Can you hear me? Yes, sir. We can, thank you. Okay. Well, I'll get started. Good afternoon. My name is Patrick Alexander and I am the general rate case manager for Cal Water Services. On behalf of Cal Water, I want to thank you for the opportunity to provide an opening remark. I would like to begin by underscoring three things. Cal Water is committed to serving our customers' best interests. There is a significant need to maintain and improve the drinking water infrastructure in our service district. And all parties involved, Cal Water, Public Advocates and our customers want the same thing at the end of this process. Safe, reliable and affordable water service. A low water bill is of little value if the water coming out of the tap is not safe for people to drink. If no water comes out of the tap at all, or if there is not adequate pressure when our firefighters need it. Cal Water is such an important part of daily life that it is easy to overlook how to deliver to our customers' homes, schools, or businesses. It takes an extensive network of water pipelines, treatment plants, wealth, tanks, and pumps to ensure water quality and reliability. We have seen the health and safety risks that can occur when infrastructure and best make those ignored. Reliable infrastructure is indispensable for providing safe, high-quality drinking water for customers every day needs and for ensuring enough water supply for firefighters to protect our communities and emergency directs. Ideally, we wanted to be there in each of our service districts in person for these public participation hearings and have the chance to interact with our customers directly. However, this hearing is for all of our districts. There are a very large number of infrastructure projects, so there is no way to address them all in today's hearing. Further, the proposed bill affects various from service district to district, which is of most interest to our customers. We place district-specific information regarding our filing on our website at www.cowater.com slash IIP. Next slide, please. I would also like to take this opportunity to promote our conservation programs, which can help customers lower their water consumption and control their bill. Additionally, information for our programs can be found on our conservation page at www.cowater.com slash conservation. Finally, we operate customer assistance program for our qualifying and low income residential customers. More information on this program can be found on our customer assistance page at www.cowater.com slash IIP. Thank you for your time. Thank you, Mr. Alexander. We will now hear from the public advocates office of the commission, also known as Cal Advocates. Sereda Gibbs, who is a program project supervisor, will take one more than two minutes to make a presentation. Ms. Gibbs, whenever you are ready. Yes, thank you, Your Honor. So, my name is Sereda Gibbs, and I am the oversight supervisor for the Cal Water GRC. I'm here today representing the public advocate's office. And I'll be brief, so I just have this one of two slides, the first slide. Just one of the highlights that identifies our mission statement, which is to advocate for the lowest possible monthly bill for customers of California regulated utilities to assist with safety, reliability, and the state's environmental goals. As the only state to teach charge with this responsibility, the public advocate represents utility customer interest before the PUC. The next slide, please. And while, yes, Sereda. So, in this slide, this provides our contact information. And of most importance, I wanted to let folks know that, however, kids who are wrapping up our final testimony, Mr. Baker, I mentioned just a moment ago, that testimony would be filed in response to Cal Water's application. So we will be filing our testimony next Tuesday on the 28th of January. Beyond that, and before that, if anyone has any questions, I've put here on this slide, our project lead, whose name is Ever Chair, which is number, my name and my contact information, as well as our website. So at any point in time, in addition to being able to provide comments on the, on the docket and on the commission's website, if anyone has any questions that we might be able to ask with this, please feel free to contact us through any of these avenues. And that's all I have here on. Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Gibbs. We now turn to the public, as mentioned, the basic purpose of this afternoon's public participation hearing is to hear directly from customers and public about Cal Water's general rate case application. We are very appreciative that you have joined us this afternoon. Again, if you want to speak and have not already done so, now is your opportunity to let us know that you want to speak. We already have close to 20 potential people, but we do want to speak, probably one bit of the screen, 188571917 enter 60327881 and press star one on your phone. And please do that now, and then the operator will add you to the queue of speakers. To ensure that we can hear you clearly, please speak directly into your phone or headset, it is best if you do not use a speaker phone. When you do speak, we ask that you speak slowly and clearly so that these demographers can hear you. This will help them transcribe everything that you say and prepare an accurate and written record of your comments. When you start to speak, the first thing you should do is state your name and equally important, please identify the service area you are calling about. We want to be able to connect your comments to the specific Cal Water Service area and Geographic area. So, it is important that you let us know and identify the service area you are calling about. And with that, let me ask the operator, how many individuals are in the queue to speak? Your Honor, we currently have 19 participants. We have 19 participants. We are going to limit the time per caller to two minutes. I would mention that if in the event that we get additional callers, we may have to reduce the time limit for the callers, but for the time being, we are going to limit the speakers time to two minutes each. A chime, a bell will sound when your time limit of two minutes is finished. Operator, please proceed with the first speaker. The public comment line is now open. Our first speaker will be Dr. Anes, Ruth Houston. Your line is open. Hello, my name is Dr. Anes, Ruth Houston. I am the Vice President of Civic Engagement with the Health and Civil Health California. Elklinfield, California is a nonprofit organization. Based in Stockton, we served the greater Central Valley, San Joaquin County, Stanislaus County. We provide ourselves with supporting low-income, minority and marginalized communities to help them achieve their full potential. Many of the individuals we support are Cal Water customers. It is no secret that California is in the midst of affordability crisis, costs are rising across the board, and California is struggling to make ends meet. Cal Water offers discounts to low-income customers and customized payment plans if they are behind on the bills. Benefits we have encouraged those we assist to explore and take advantage of. Cal Water has become a trusted community partner and has demonstrated its commitment to the premise that clean waters shouldn't be accessible to a privileged few who can afford it, but accessible to everyone. They offer a variety of programs that can assist in saving water to lower bills and financial assistance and have worked to structure their rates so that those who use more pay more make it easier to save on monthly water bills. A utilities' pro-lock to support and commitment to affordability are a huge help to struggling people, and we hope other utilities emulate them as well. We really appreciate the opportunity to comment today. Thank you so much for the opportunity. Thank you, Dr. Houston. Before we go to the next caller, just want to remind the caller's, in addition to stating your name, it might be helpful if you spell it for the record that we can have an accurate spelling on the transcript. Again, please remind us of the service area at the part of the state that you are calling from. Thank you. Can I get an operator please announce the next speaker? Our next public comment comes from a net cave resident. Your line is open. Hi. I would comment that I think water rates are already significantly out of balance with other providers. My name is Annette Caves, CAVES. I live in San Carlos, and just to compare, tar waters rates to Redwood City, which is next door. Both systems have four rate tiers. The lowest rate tier for tar water is 1 to 6, and the highest is 13 plus units. Where Redwood City is zero to 10 units as they are lowest rate and 21 units. If you look at this, at the highest rate for Cal Water at 13 units, it is over $25 per unit, and in the Redwood City area at 21 units at their highest rate is only $15 and change. I feel that Cal Water is already charging exorbitant amounts, both in having very low rate tiers. It is easier to bump up to a very high rate, and in terms of cost per unit at the highest tier, again, $25 versus 15 and change. I see how this justifies another significant rate increase of 17% and I think 8%. I feel that they are already charging too much for what they provide as compared to similar providers in our area. So I am hoping that this rate change will be denied, and I would also like the CPUC to consider asking Cal Water why the rate tiers are so skewed as to bump people into the highest levels as soon as possible. Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Caves, and thank you for spending the last name and letting us know that you are calling from San Carlos. That information is very helpful. Thank you. Operator, next speaker please. Our next public comment comes from Sherry, Sousa, Livermore Valley, Chamber of Commerce. Your line is open. Thank you very much. Good afternoon, your honor and commissioner. Thank you for the opportunity to speak today. My name is Sherry Sousa and that's spelled SOUZA. I am the CEO of the Livermore Chamber of Commerce. The Livermore Chamber of Commerce represents over 400 businesses in the Livermore Valley. California Water Service is an important part of our community and a good community partner inclusive of our business community. Even how important infrastructure is to the business community, I am calling to support Cal Water's proposal to invest in our water infrastructure. Cal Water is planning to replace almost four miles of old water main here. They want to upgrade existing and install new water treatment. They want to improve storage tanks and renew two wells in our area. Cal Water has a track record of doing a very good job maintaining and improving their water system and we want them to continue with that. I support Cal Water's proposal to continue its investment in their water infrastructure in Livermore and thank you very much for the opportunity again. Thank you, Sousa. Operator, please announce the next speaker. Our next public comment comes from Charles B. Your line is open. You have to can you hear me? Yes, Mr. Bean, go ahead. Yes, my name is Charles Bean, the EHNE and I am in the Redwood Valley area district and I'm a resident and a Cal Water customer. I am calling in support of Cal Water's this proceeding and I must say I have not always been a fan of Cal Water. In the past I was actually with a group that community group here that opposed Cal Water. But since then in the last few years I have come to know Cal Water a lot better and understand a lot more about what they do. They do try to help out with our affordability. In fact, they were the ones who got us consolidated with a larger district. We are very small districts which are raised considerably and I believe that they really need these increases so that we can keep providing water when we need it that is so important as we have seen in the last few years. They have also they also are have become a real part and help out in our community. And I believe that's it. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Bean. Operator, please announce the next public comment. Our next public comment comes from Dr. Mrs. Coutenco, cover list of studios. Your line is open. Thank you so much for allowing our participation. That is Key Like Tom K, a T-H-E-M-K-O, silent T. And we are residents of West Lake Village area, the thousand-oak area. And our main concern is the affordability. The general affordability is generally not affordable right now. Everybody is feeling the pinch. Also at a customer level I called three separate times the local number to contact Cal Water because I wanted to speak to someone prior to this call. I spoke with Vanessa, I spoke with Asmranda, I was never able to speak with Donald as supervisor. So again, with these sorts of rate increases I would expect definitely a better customer service relationship with the local Cal Water which I don't currently have. And I was also dismayed that this call was late. In such an important format like this I would expect everyone to have been even early. So that's a peak. But what I wanted to end with is my concern regarding these rate raises, they will be used administratively and not really go to what is necessary. And I just wanted to bring up the fact that we California voted on a bond proposition in 2014, a 7.5 billion or some would say 7.12 billion would be. And to my knowledge, no water storage projects have been completed. So I need to do a deep dive on that and research it. But those are my concerns that just by wrote these water rates will not adequately go to the infrastructure where it's needed. And the California does not have a very good track record regarding that. So thank you again for your time. I do hope you take our comments into consideration. Thank you, Mr. Bajan. Operator? Yes. It's a secret. Our next public comment is Irene Surop, JK Global Relo State Consultant. Your line is open. Good afternoon. Can you hear me? Okay. Yes, we can. Mr. Surop, go ahead. Thank you. My name is Karim Surop. Last name is both S as in SAMH, A-W-R-A-F. I am a community association manager above all things. And representing approximately hundreds, if not thousands of residents living in multi-residential communities. And HOAs in San Mateo County, spanning approximately 22 municipalities. I am questioning the rate increase and how Cal water arrived at the proposed rate increases. Who incidentally far, a lot of my associations, two-inch water service connection fee, went up. Approximately 13 percent starting in May, end of May of 2024. And that was just before Cal water service filed their 2024 infrastructure improvement plan. So that's a $24.5 across the board, 13 percent increase in just before they filed their plan. And not only that, but the CCF or the ACF rates went up from $9.22 on average to $10.14 on average, which is a 10 percent increase. So again, I question those fees as well as public purpose programs that our associations that are being charged for are pretty much without explanation. And I don't think that that's a charge that paying customers should be charged because other programs are designed to help others that need to help financially. It should not be voluntarily. So again, I'm questioning the practices and how Cal water arrived at the proposed rate increases. But also should use that new rate increases that just happened before the infrastructure plan should be considered. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Suraugh. Operator, next public comment please. Next public comment comes from Stephen Wexer. Your line is open. Hi. So Stephen Wexler, W-E-X-L-E-R, I live in San Carlos, which is the Bay Area District. I'm just wondering if anyone's actually looked at the prices or the price structure for the Bay Area District because they're in same. Cal water is proposing a top rate of over $50 per CCF starting at only 20 CCF per month, which is six times more expensive than the nearby Bay or Gulf District. And multiple times more expensive than every other district in the proposal. With the recent changes this summer, we already have the highest water rates in the entire Bay Area. I actually looked at every single district and were by far the highest rates already. And this proposal now takes it to the extreme, literally doubling rates at the upper tiers. Please stop this madness. It's one thing to request rate increases because they're rising cost of business, although 36% over three years is crazy. However, instead of spreading this cost increase among all their customers, this rate structure unfairly discriminates against larger families who are subsidizing ultra low rates for apartment dwellers and small households. They've also chosen to keep non-residential rates roughly flat, again shifting the cost burden on to larger families. That's not fair at all. This proposal will cause extreme hardship on families and needs to be rejected. It's a clear violation of the Public Utility Code Section of 421, which provides that all charges demanded or received by any public utility shall be just and reasonable. There is nothing just or reasonable about this rate structure and $50 per CCF of water. And you must throw it away and go back to the drawing board. I'd be happy to work with Cal Water and Public Outfit Cuts Office to come up with a more equitable rate structure. One obvious path forward would be to merge the Bay Area Districts in close geographic vicinity and both purchase the water from the SFPUC. Thanks. Thank you, Mr. Wrechler. Operator, please announce the next public comment. Our next public comment comes from Ken Caffel. Your line is open. Yes, can you hear me? Yes, Mr. Caster, go ahead. Yes, Ken Caffel, CIS, TLE, also a resident of San Carlos, the Bay Area Region. I absolutely completely agree with the comments made from Stephen Wrechler. What I want to talk about is transparency. The requirement that you have set for Cal Water to notify rate payers with letters about upcoming hearing such as this public form and proposed rate increases are not transparent. You are saying that the Cal Water is only required to quote the lowest tier or the average residential customer bill increase. Well, I've got news for you. How would San Carlos the same as South San Francisco or Diggie City or Colma, whether are largely apartments, cooler temperatures and so forth, where San Carlos is sort of in the banana belt and with more single family homes in those other cities? That's not fair. And for them to exclude the entire tier structure, including that $50 rate is absolute garbage. That's a PR stunt. And for you not to enforce the requirement to provide the entire tier structure so that people don't have to go digging forward online is ridiculous. Shame on you. The second thing is in terms of that last year there was a large increase on our water bills in the early summer and nobody realized until Cal Water appeared before the City Council that they were bundling two fair increases. Two rate increases together because one had been delayed for a while. There was no advanced notice to rate payers on that situation and people were getting $800 and $1000 bills wondering what the heck is going on. We're not using more water than we did a year ago. Also, I think you need to take a deep look at how the meter reading is occurring. These are humans that go out and supposedly pull up the lids and read the meters. Well, a lot of people have indicated that when they pull up the meter, they're hard to read. And without electronic remote technologies like PG&E and other water agencies have, we can't be confident that the meter reads are accurate or that there isn't something else that's guiding these in terms of being different days, different sites. So I think there needs to be a deep look into the process of meter reading. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Castell. Operator, please announce the next speaker. Our next public comment comes from Tia Fleming, California Water Efficiency. Your line is open. Thank you. Yes. My name is Tia Fleming, SLEM, I-N-G, and I'm the co-executive director of the California Water Efficiency Partnership. We're based in Sacramento, but we work across all of the 23 distinct service districts of Cal Water. We work with Cal Water Service on a variety of projects and research over the past 20 years, and I'm calling it in support of Cal Water and their work. Cal Water, we work with over 200 of the urban water suppliers across the state, and our mission is to maximize urban water efficiency and conservation throughout California. Cal Water really shares our commitment, and they're doing that in the community that they serve. Water Efficiency and Conservation provide a host of environmental and community benefits, especially as we face hotter, drier years in California, and as the state supply strategy directs urban suppliers to increase their resilience. Cal Water is a leader among water suppliers when it comes to water conservation and water use efficiency. We spotlighted their work and they're always easier to help other agencies facing similar problems. They've also led the way doing research on the cost effectiveness of water conservation with our partner organization, the Alliance for Water Efficiency. They're really taking a holistic approach that highlights the value of water conservation for its own sake and the appropriate stewardship of our limited precious resource, as well as the incredible value it can have to customers to help lower water bills. Cal Water engages in education around these topics. They're trying to share information with their customers about the many benefits that we all got through water conservation and efficiencies. They're engaged in so much work across the state, including furthering research into water resource planning, water recycling, sustainable operations, and again the cost effectiveness of water conservation and efficiency and power to support all these efforts. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Fleming. Operator, please announce the next speaker. Our next public comment comes from Donna Duperon, Torrance Area Chamber of Commerce. Your line is open. Good afternoon. My name is Donna Duperon, C-U-P-E-R-R-O-N, CEO of the Torrance Area Chamber of Commerce. The Torrance Area Chamber of Commerce represents 829 businesses, and we pride ourselves on creating a more business-friendly climate in the South Bay region of Los Angeles. We're also committed to ensuring the Torrance Area has a strong quality of life for our residents and businesses, and having clean, reliable water is an important asset. Whether they're a bakery, making dough, or a laundromat helping families get through their weak flondery, our businesses need to know that when they turn on the tap, they will have access to a reliable supply of clean water. And we also understand that a reliable water supply requires ongoing maintenance and infrastructure investment to keep systems in peak conditions. Additionally, investments in water infrastructure create and sustain jobs in our region, not just for the people working on the projects, but for the businesses that serve Torrance. Cow water prioritizes investing in their water system to give our residents and businesses that confidence. Over the last decade, Cow water has invested over$16 million locally, including installing new pipes, treatment facilities, pumps, and fire hydrants, along with upgrading or retrofitting storage tanks and wells. These investments are why Cow water continues to be a strong part of the Torrance community and an organization our members depend on. We appreciate the opportunity to comment today. Thank you very much. Is Duperano, thank you very much operator. Next speaker please. Our next public comment comes from Connor Everett, Environmental Justice Coalition for Water. Your line is open. Thank you very much. Connor Everett, spelled co and NER, last name, e, b is in Victor, ERTS. I am an elder advisor to the Environmental Justice Coalition for Water, which is based out of Stockton region, and we're talking about that area. I'm actually calling in from Los Angeles. I was hoping that this hearing would actually be in person, especially for Environmental Justice Group, within the regions that we're talking about. Nevertheless, I will take this opportunity to say that we have fought for the human rights, per water, and affordability issues in underserved communities for a long time now. That makes me very old on these issues, but I would want to give that region around Stockton credit for what Cow water has done working with community based organizations to do water conservation. Something I've long felt is a priority for many reasons. They worked with local groups, and we appreciate their commitment for making us support on these communities. Now and into the future. Very quickly, because the issue of a fire is brought up and I understand it's not under this rate case, I think it's important to say that there are many communities. Altadena has five individual water agencies serving a small dense area, and they are unable and don't have the capacity to provide clean drinking water. So we need to think into the future just beyond the simple rate cases how we can really apply the human right to water across the state, and all of the plan for the driest day plus fire. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Edwards. Operator, next public comment. Our next public comment comes from Kevin Peters. Resident, your line is open. Hello, how are you, Runner? And attendees of the hearing, can you hear me? Okay. If Mr. Peters go ahead, what are you calling from? Great. And if Kevin Peters, I am from Livermore. I would like to begin by acknowledging that as a resident of Livermore, I can say that I've never had much of a concern for water safety or reliability. As Cal water has done a great job at keeping our water safe and available, so I'm grateful for and commend them for that. To follow my interest in this hearing is two parts. Number one, as laid out, I do not understand at all how the consolidation with Dixon is beneficial for me as a consumer. The highlights in the letter I received were notes that consolidation would improve reliability, sorry, it would improve affordability. However, I don't see that consolidation improving my rates. It increases my rates, which appears to be in direct contradiction of the advisory. I don't understand why Cal water would advocate for consolidation, which appears to be an administrative positive for them, but results in a net negative for me. Number two, as someone who was born and raised in the East Bay under EB mud water, I was raised in a region with excellent water quality and taste. After that, I went down to school in San Luis Biscoe for college and had Cal water as my provider, and unfortunately, it was very disappointed in the taste and hardness. After that, upon moving to Livermore with Cal water, again, I was extremely disappointed with the taste, but of course, I understand that it's still safe. On the whole, I'm not opposed to pricing increases in the absolute. However, I want to ensure that these increases are going towards something that goes to benefit the population. At present, I do not understand how these increases will contribute to benefits for us. I'm definitely okay with increases if it yields considerable improvements in taste and minerality akin to EB mud. The taste is obvious, but the minerality also yields substantial upkeep costs for the public as line scale and plumbing degrades. That means more service calls for either poor flow or complete failure. Before we move forward with increases, I want to see equivalent rate comparisons for other water providers in the area. And back to the area. From others who have compared, these proposed increases are wildly in excess of comparisons, so please convince me that these are reasonable. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Peters. Operator, next public comment. Our next public comment comes from Clinton, Olivier, Business Federation of the Central Valley. Your line is open. Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you all the afternoon. It's Clinton, Olivier, O-L-I-V, as Invictor, I-E-R. I'm with the Central Valley Business Federation. I'd like to speak in favor of Cal Waters 2024 Infrastructure Improvement Plan Proposal. Cal Water provides safe, clean water reliably and affordably to more than half a million California homes and businesses, as we know. We also know that water that is not safe to drink just isn't worth it. A seemingly low water bill doesn't benefit anyone. If no water comes out of the tap or the water that comes out is unsafe to drink, water is a finite precious resource and California cannot afford to waste it because improvements in infrastructure are denied. No person, family, or business wants to pay more, but infrastructure that is at the end of its useful life has to be turned over and replaced. And it's an organization that represents members in the construction and building industry, as well as homeowners, renters, tenants. Our members are feeling the impact of the fact that the price to build anything in California is skyrocketing, with driving up costs on those needed infrastructure investments that doesn't and should not be the reason to invest in our drinking water infrastructure. Further, we strongly urge the restoration of full decoupling, which research indicates presents cost savings for end-use customers. Thank you for the opportunity to speak this afternoon. Thank you, Mr. Media. Operator, next speaker please. Our next public comment comes from Richard Jewel, resident. Your line is open. Yeah, I wasn't planning on talking this thing in all my name is Richard Jewel, JGWEL, and I'm a resident in Mary's Bill, California. The biggest thing I know is right off the top, your honor said that the tax rate was going to increase 17%, 26, and 8, and 27, and 8, and 28. Well, the mail I got says, you know, it's going to be 6.9, and I'm sorry, 6.9 and 26, 11.8 and 27, and 11.9 and 28. And to me, that just seemed like a dishonest flyer, or dishonest letter that I got in, which makes my skepticism of the need for this, or the honesty in the clarity in physics. If there's anything, you know, somebody can show me, I'd appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Jewel. Operator, next public comment please. Our next public comment comes from Alicia Harry, California, Hawaii, AACP. Your line is open. Hello, good afternoon. I'm Steve Harry, TA in EICI-A, A-E-R-I-D-I, and the government relations specialist, listed California, Hawaii State Conference, under NAACP. Our organization advocates for the civil rights of Latin Americans, but we've been in more than 60 branches of the community's dot-talloplayer, especially in Silicon Valley, and LA area. One of our most pressing issues facing the residents can be in Silicon Valley, East, Access, the Clean Water. According to a court by the World Water Council, at the 391-Tallopoyants from LA communities of color, and low income communities, primarily in the Central Valley, and southern, sorry, and southern LA residents, are certainly to water by the water providers. These communities are among the last communities to be prioritized for infrastructure improvements to address these water quality concerns. Our water has been a long time partner of the NWCP, and one of the things we appreciate about the company is how they are prioritized access to the state, clean and affordable water for all of the districts and all of the customers. The open social higher centers than what the state requires when it comes to water quality, and prioritizes extensive testing at the right to the investments in water infrastructure to protect the state. We also have worked with some of the NWCP plants and the service territories to share information about water conservation and low income assistance programs they offer for the customers. This proactive approach is something that other utilities have not strived or should strived to anyway. We appreciate our partnership with Cal Water, and I think you can make this a wrap up. Thank you. Thank you, Missouri. Operator, next speaker please. Thank you. Our next public comment comes from Stan Hendricks. A resident? Your line is open. I stand Hendricks H&DRIO calling from Rdondo Beach. I'm interested in eliminating PFAS or the forever chemicals from the water supply. So to the extent that Cal Water has funding in their latest proposal to do that, I heartily support that. What I'd like to know is when does Cal Water plan to begin testing for PFAS? You know, wherever it is, I'd like to do it as quickly as possible because I've recently spent a little bit of money to send a sample off to a lab for testing. I haven't gotten the result back yet, but I'm very much interested in eliminating PFAS forever chemicals from our water supply. Okay, thank you. So thank you, Mr. Hendricks. Operator, next speaker. Thank you. Our next public comment comes from Vincenzo Caraza with the Public Works Director, City of Maryville. Your line is open. Good afternoon. Can you hear me? Yes, we good. I'll have you spray your last name, sir. So thank you, Your Honor and Commissioners. It's Vincenzo Caraza spelled at the Military alphabet as Charlie Oscar Romeo Alpha Zulu Alpha. I am the Public Works Director for the City of Maryville and we are in Cal Water's Maryville District. I want to start off by saying the statement from the city is that, quote, the City of Maryville expressed a strong opposition to California Water Services proposed 33% rate increase. This significant rate hike would disproportionately impact Maryville's residents who already face higher water rates compared to neighboring jurisdictions. And this Ackeres Mr. Kessel, your earlier comment, and also Richard Duo, one of our residents. In regards to Cal Water's transparency, their process, I think, was just mailing a letter to our residents, but the city was not consulted. I am the owner and operator of our return cycle. So Cal Water provides the water to the taps and the city takes the sewer collections and we take the water from the drain into our system. So we were not consulted or discussed. And so in the, I just found out about this meeting from our City Council meeting this past Tuesday. And we are actually holding another special session, City Council tonight to talk about this. So the public is going to come and, you know, we talk with them over this issue. But the thing is that it's the lack of communication that we have. And there's a lot of questions that I submitted through your online portal. There's 12 questions. I don't want to read them over. But essentially there's residents and the council are just wondering how are you going to sell this rate? What is it going to be? What is the current situation of your needs? But it looks like the Cal Water is just going through a whole statewide and didn't specifically address that. So I think what will help is if Cal Water does their road show and comes and has a town hall. And that way the residents and the council can ask questions and go back and forth. So I think that would help. But in the meantime, we are currently strong opposing this increase. And that's it. Thank you for your time. Thank you very much. Operator next public comment. Thank you. Our next public comment comes from Tim Quinn. It's greater Stockton Chamber of Commerce. Your line is open. Thank you. Hello. My name is Tim Quinn. Q. U. I. N. N. I'm the CEO of the Greater Stockton Chamber of Commerce Service Area Stockton, California. Speaking in support of Cal Water, thousands of local business owners are represented by the Greater Stockton Chamber of Commerce, the Central Valley's preeminent business organization for over a century. We work tirelessly to promote economic growth and improve the quality of life for businesses and residents alike. Our community depends on robust infrastructure to thrive reliable water systems are essential for our businesses and residents. Restaurants, hospitals, manufacturers and many others rely on clean water to succeed and Stockton residents depend on it for a high quality of life. The Stockton Chamber of Commerce is proud to work with California Water Service, a trusted partner and committed to delivering safe, clean and reliable water to our residents and businesses. Cal waters continued investments in their infrastructure network give our business conferences to grow. While residents have peace of mind knowing their water systems are prepared for the challenges of today and the needs of tomorrow, modern infrastructure ensures stock in the residents and resilience will be resilient and continued to be competitive. The chamber supports Cal waters commitment to improving our city's infrastructure and addressing the needs of business and residents alike. This helps us all collectively secure a sustainable future for our community. Thank you for your time today. Thank you Mr. Quinn. For those of you who are viewing this online and might have noticed we have some technical issues with the screen but we're all here via audio and we'll continue with this public participation hearing operator. Please announce the next speaker. Thank you. Our next comment comes from Edward Cardinal. Your line is open. Hi, yes, thank you very much. My name is Edward Culldwell, C-A-L-D-W-E-L-L and I am the General Manager of the West Basin Municipal Water District. West Basin is a water wholesaler. It serves 17 cities and an incorporated portion of LA County including Culver City, Carson, El Segundo, Malibu and the Palaforiz Peninsula. I'm calling to speak in support of Cal Point Water Service, one of our eight customer agencies. We work very closely with Cal Water and an important and valuable partnership. Cal Water shares our commitment to water conservation and to being great stewards of our valuable finite precious resource. In fact, Cal Point Water Service has joined West Basin Municipal Water District and Partnership to live and recycle water to our communities including our most recent projects, the Palaforiz Lateral Project and the Juanita Milandro McDonald Regional Water Restiple and Facility Project, which will improve the water security for our region. Water infrastructure investments are a key component of water conservation and resource management. Now more than ever, we understand that water systems must be reliable to deliver water while minimizing waste. Water systems require long-term vision and investment planning. In fact, we understand that we stand behind the investments that they seek to make and we know that they will have a long-term impact. Cal Water proposal includes a new well and the rehab being of an existing well, both in the South Bay region, which falls within the West Basin Servic area. We support their plan to upgrade their groundwater pumping facilities in this area and we believe it will help us achieve our regional strategies in our urban water management plan. Cal Point Water is a good partner to a water conservation and a water supply and our water supply planning and we support their proposal. Thank you very much. Mr. Codwell, thank you very much. Operator, next public comment. Thank you. Our next comment comes from John Beckman, Building Industry Association of the Greater Valley. Your line is open. Good afternoon. My name is John Beckman. I'm the CEO of the Building Industry Association of the Greater Valley. Our last name is BECKMAN. We are the Central Valley chapter of the California Building Industry Association, representing home builders in Calaveras, Mariposa, Merced, Sandwalkine, Stannislots, and Tuwallini counties. Water is a key issue that is intrinsically linked to housing. Before new housing development can proceed, they must demonstrate that they have reliable access to water to serve future homeowners and residents. Cal Water is the water utility supplying communities in many of the same areas where we do business. We appreciate Cal Water's proactive approach to investing in infrastructure. I recognize home builders and future residents may not be enthusiastic about a potential rate increase, but current economic conditions and the ongoing need to ensure water systems are maintained make rate increases a necessity. Since 2012, the California Construction Cost Index, which estimates the hard costs associated with construction throughout the state, has increased by 74% through 2024. The upward trend means construction projects are more expensive than they have in the past, but they are necessary to ensure that utilities like Cal Water can continue to deliver clean and reliable water to homes and businesses. People need to know that when they turn on their taps, the water that runs out is clean and free of contamination. Thank you for letting us share our thoughts and please support continued investments in critical infrastructure. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Bergman, operator. Next part of the comment. Thank you. Our next comment comes from Marie de Comas, but resident of Portola Valley. Your line is open. Thank you. That's Comas, C-O-M-E-S. I'm a resident of Portola Valley, a person that cannot drink my bare gulch water out of my faucet or cook with it. And with the increase of the housing elements for each town in California, you would think that the price of water access for customers would be going down instead of up. I know that's not the topic, but it makes everyone here worry if there will be water for them in an emergency for drinking and fire suppression. Keep the price increases realistic. Since builders of towns are the ones that have to pay for the infrastructure improvements and the people that are building houses, not Cal Water, keep it cost effective for families that are just using water for everyday living. A 33% increase is just too much of an increase when somebody else is usually putting the bill for the infrastructure. Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Comas, operator. Next part of the comment. Thank you. Our next public comment comes from Shilpa Gupta, a resident of Santa Clara District. Your line is open. Yes, thank you, everyone. And thank you for giving me the opportunity to comment here. This is Shilpa Gupta, I'm a resident of Los Alters in the Santa Clara community. I'm here to strongly oppose the proposed rate increases and the current residential rate structure that qual water is presenting. Water rates in California are already among the highest in the nation. And these rates are simply unsustainable. Take, for example, a typical family in Los Alters where residents are paying anywhere an average of $400 per month for water and already exorbitant rate, but it doesn't stop there. There are some households which are paying 389 per month, but the cost of having a two-inch water pipe. And when you add water usage to it, the bills can be easily $700 to $800 per month. Absolutely unreasonable. Please stop the madness. Also, it is fundamentally unfair. And I would argue unconstitutional to charge higher water rates in wealthier communities with the assumption that they can absorb these costs in order to subsidize rates in other areas. The idea that residents of Vellier community should be disproportionately burdened to cover for other families is flawed and unjust. If Cal Water truly wants to be efficient, it should start by ensuring that all consumers are charged equally, no hidden subsidies. Additionally, Cal Water should look internally, eliminate any unnecessary overhead costs or jobs that do not directly contribute to providing the service of improving infrastructure. I strongly oppose this rate increase and I urge Cal Water to reconsider and work towards reducing these outrageous proposed charges. In fact, decreasing the charge for any two-inch water pipe in residential homes. Please stop the madness. Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Vector, operator. Next speaker. Thank you. Our next public comment comes from Jesse Snyder with Self-Help Enterprises. Your line is open. Hello, good afternoon. My name is Jesse Snyder. I'm with Self-Help Enterprises, we're a nonprofit affordable housing and community development organization. I just wanted to provide the commentary that we work with Cal Water in a couple of different contexts. They've been a stellar partner in all ways. We primarily work with them to consolidate small struggling water systems into the Cal Water system. They've been a great steadfast partner in those projects. Then we also develop new housing and install infrastructure and work with Cal Water on several projects in that way. They've also been a great partner there. Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Snyder. Operator, next public comment. Thank you. Judge, there are no more speakers on the public comment telephone line. Thank you very much, operator. In that case, that concludes all the speakers who signed up to speak today. If any of you would like to provide additional input or comments after this hearing, you may submit written comments for this proceeding on this screen. You will see information about how to do that online. The website is... I just realized that one additional speaker has been added operator. Who's the next speaker? One moment. Thank you, operator. Our next comment comes from Sarah McDowell. Your line is open. Good afternoon. My name is Sarah McDowell. I'm the CDOWEL and I am the mayor of San Carlos. The views expressed today are my personal opinions and do not reflect the views of the city of San Carlos or its city council. San Carlos is part of Cal Waters Bay Area region and rates for higher water users have increased exponentially in recent months. I did submit my written comments online but today I wish to cover three main concerns expressed by our community. Number one, Cal Water Public Noticing process is not transparent. The notice included in the Cal Water January 2025 customer invoices dated rates for consumers using 6 CCF permits. Details on all proposed rate tiers are not noticed in the bill and that should not be acceptable. Number two, all customers should contribute to infrastructure improvements. If rate increases are needed to offset infrastructure improvements, which benefit everyone benefits from regardless of water use, Cal Water should consider spreading smaller cost increases across all tiers. Number three, the proposed rate increases overly burdened multi-individual households including those with affordable housing while giving small households a price break. Cal Water stated the average person uses two CCFs of water permits. The proposed rates give households a three or less a massive price break at 6 CCF. Health will be five using 10 CCFs will experience an increase from $9 per CCF prior to June 2024 to $25 per CCF with the proposed rate. Cities are complying with state housing mandates by encouraging residents to build affordable housing like 80 use accessory dwelling units. Residents raising children in a main home and housing in-laws that caregiver or a college student in an ADU could easily exceed 10 CCFs of water in a month simply by housing more people on one month. While I absolutely understand and appreciate the needs, maintain adequate infrastructure, I also need to note that St. Carlos residents are paying some of the highest water rates in the Bay area. High water rates are not just impacting households that need to be incentivized to conserve. They are also impacting multi-individual households that are using the bare minimum. The rate structure seems flawed and action is needed to restore equity to consumers. Please pause any rate increases until these issues are addressed. Thank you. Thank you very much operator. My name is we have another speaker. Thank you. Our next comment comes from Tim Shibur a resident. Your line is open. Tim Shibur spelled Sierra Hotel Acker Papa off to Delta Delta resident of Livermore. And I contend it and ask that you please reject the application to consolidate Livermore with Dixon forming the outlaw ranch region because of the deception in the description of the upcoming rate increases per the informational mailing from Cal Water Service. The consolidation is to improve affordability, take advantage of administrative efficiencies and stabilize rates long term. To actually do the math, it does the opposite. It yet has an additional increase to the water rate and does nothing to stabilize rates. So I asked that this deceptive practice be stopped by the Public Utility Commission because they're climbing improved affordability yet causing additional increases per the increases that are already out there. Thank you for the chance to speak for providing safe water. Have a nice day. Thank you, Mr. Shibur. Operator, do we have any other speakers? No, we do not. Thank you, Operator. I conclude other speakers who have signed up to speak again if anyone wants to provide additional input or comments after this afternoon hearing. You may submit written comments for this proceeding. On the website there's a link with information about how to do so. On the top right hand corner of the screen you will find a search box.

And with the top of that page you will find a button titled Add Public Comment. Click on it and follow the directions and you will be able to provide written public comment in this proceeding. If you need assistance with providing additional comments, you may contact the Commission's Public Advisors Office and their email is public.advisor at cpuc.ca.gov. That concludes this public participation hearing. I want to thank Commissioner Baker and his staff. I want to thank the parties who made presentations here. I'd like to thank the stenographers. The Commission staff working behind the scenes to help make this virtual public participation hearing possible. I also want to thank all the members of the public and community for your input and comments today. Thank you all very much. We are now adjourned and off to record.",
